It has now also climbed back above the 50-day moving average, too. The rally is seemingly not yet too stretched, either. The S\u0026P’s 14-day relative strength index, a closely watched momentum gauge, started Wednesday’s session around 64. That is tucked nicely below the supposedly “oversold” threshold of 70.The CBOE Vix index, an option-based measure of expected stock market volatility known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was above 21 on the day after the US polls closed. Seven days later it was back below 14, making insurance relatively cheap for those wishing to hold long equity positions.So far, so bullish. But investors need to differentiate, given the Trump-inspired wholesale sector rotations of late.“Correlations among S\u0026P 500 stocks have continued to contract over the last week, reflective of a market with clear pockets of strength and weakness post-election,” says Strategas Research. “This stands in contrast to the behaviour following prior macro events over the last 18 months.”jamie.chisholm@ft.com","description":"Equities look strong from technical perspective, above both 200- and 50-day

macroeconomic theories will rise and fall in status because of Donald Trump?","body":"Which macroeconomic theories will rise and fall in status because of Donald Trump?\n\nIt seems likely that Trump and a Republican Congress can agree on some big mix of tax cuts and spending.  Furthermore, there are plenty of rumors that Trump may push on the independence of the Fed and the ten-year yield leaped upon his election.  So odds are it will be a stimulus with some degree of monetary accommodation, and in that case even tax cuts for the wealthy can serve as an effective form of QE into the assets the wealthy invest in.\n\nAnd yet 80% of economists are Democrats, many top economists signed a petition opposing Trump, and I can’t think of a single top economist who has endorsed Trump.  So clearly something has to give, and here are some theories that may rise or fall in status:\n\n1. “The multiplier is high.”  That seems ready to decline in status.\n\n2. “Even wasteful expenditures can boost demand and help pull us out of secular stagnation.”  Ditto.  “We need to do stimulus right” will make a comeback.  And I see “the distributional effects of stimulus really matter” lurking around the corner.\n\n3. “Tax cuts aren’t as good as government spending.”  That actually may rise in status, especially if Congress gets the bargain they want — lots of tax cuts — rather than what Trump wants.\n\n4. The notion of how a credibly irresponsible leader can improve macro performance won’t get cited as much.\n\n5.

Which seems a little bit of a fusion with some European influences, the way they use potato and tomato in that soup with local seafood.\n\nCOWEN: As you know, the Michelin Guide recently has covered Shanghai, given some restaurants three, two, one star. There’s cheap places you can go. Conceptually, do they understand the food of Shanghai? To the extent they don’t, what are they missing?\n\nDUNLOP: If you look at the restaurants they’ve selected, there’s a bit of a Cantonese bias. They do have some Shanghainese restaurants, but one thing that’s very conspicuous, there are some notable, some of the best Shanghainese local restaurants, which are missing from that list, in my opinion.\n\nThe reason is, I think, the methodology of Western food inspectors, which is they tend to go as individuals or small groups. Of course in many Chinese restaurants where you eat family style, to make the most of the restaurant, you have to eat as we’re doing now with a large group and a table full of dishes.\n\nWe cover much more, including her favorite parts of China, whether offal is an inferior good, whether one can acquire a taste for sea cucumber, what she thinks of Leonard Cohen, Dream of the Red Chamber, how newbies should approach Chinese food, what top Sichuan chefs thought of their trip to French Laundry, whether milk is overrated, whether Americans have done anything worthwhile with Chinese food, and her favorite Chinese movie.\n\nHere is a short video excerpt from the Sichuan peppercorn tasting segment, namely what makes the very best peppercorns so good compared to the lesser peppercorns.\n\nHere you can order Fuchsia’s new and excellent book The Land of Fish and Rice.\n\nPrevious post: Deviations from covered interest parity, explained\n\nNext post: Is America’s racism problem getting better or worse?","description":"Here is the link to video, podcast, and transcript.  The Q\u0026A segment was led by guests Ezra Klein, Megan McArdle, Mark Miller (Coyote Cafe), and Eva Summer.  Fuchsia speaks in perfect British sentences and she always had an answer ready, […]","keywords":"","time":1479308562,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marginalrevolution/feed/~3/wqIep0a22oo/conversation-fuchsia-dunlop.html"},{"title":"Deviations from covered interest parity, explained","body":"Deviations from covered interest parity, explained\n\nThe new BIS working paper (pdf) by Stefan Avdjiev, Wenxin Du, Catherine Koch, and Hyun Song Shin really does seem to do the trick.  Here is the abstract:\n\nWe document the triangular relationship formed by the strength of the US dollar, cross-border bank lending in dollars and deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). A stronger dollar goes hand-in-hand with bigger deviations from CIP and contractions of cross-border bank lending in dollars. Differential sensitivity of CIP deviations to the strength of the dollar can explain cross-sectional variations in CIP arbitrage profits. Underpinning the triangle is the role of the dollar as proxy for the shadow price of bank leverage.\n\nI would put it this way (my interpretation, not theirs): liquidity is more expensive than you think, and leverage is more expensive too, as are risk-free assets.  And hidden beneath the formal results of this paper is an optimistic message about the financial sector and also economic growth.  If “riskless” arbitrage is that hard to pull off, just imagine what losses economies must be suffering due to inadequate arbitrage across the borrowing rate on regular funds and the rate of return on capital.  And imagine how much gain there is to be had from making such (risky) arbitrage easier to pull off.  On the down side, the implication is that intermediation today is more fragile than we had thought.\n\nIzabella Kaminska has an important post on all of this.  “The stronger dollar makes global financial intermediation more expensive” is an underrated idea that at least you should try on for size.\n\nPrevious post: In defense of Facebook\n\nNext post: My conversation with Fuchsia Dunlop","description":"The new BIS working paper (pdf) by Stefan Avdjiev, Wenxin Du, Catherine Koch, and Hyun Song Shin really does seem to do the trick.  Here is the abstract: We document the triangular relationship formed by the strength of the US […]","keywords":"","time":1479280433,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marginalrevolution/feed/~3/dXeqeRWi5VE/deviations-covered-interest-parity-explained.html"},{"title":"In defense of Facebook","body":"In defense of Facebook\n\nThe NYT offers a variety of Facebook criticisms.  Probably you already have heard the latest:\n\nDonald J.

This can have only one outcome; reduced national gas prices overall and less coal consumption.\n\nRoberts and Plumer at Vox:\n\nYou can see a partial list of past House Republican bills here.

Even if not imposed, the renewed demand for term limits provides further evidence for the conflict theory of term limits (and here).\n\nImagine that there are two rival coalitions in a region and that each fears the other will gain and hold on to power for an extended period of time. This fear can be motivated by two factors. First, the longer a coalition expects to be in power the more likely it is to exploit another coalition. Or, to put the issue the other way, the greater the expected rotation of power the less likely the presently ruling coalition is to exploit other coalitions. Until May of 1994 South African blacks had little legal political power. Nevertheless, as the prospect of future black political power increased the South African government became constrained in its actions towards South African blacks. The prospect of black power in the future moderated white power today. Second, if coalitions are risk averse they will prefer to rotate power with rival coalitions, and in this way share the spoils of governing rather than gamble upon winning or losing all political power for a lengthy period of time. Term limits are one method of increasing the rotation of political power.\n\nWhen a politician’s term is over the election for the open seat is more competitive than it would be if an incumbent were running. By increasing the number of open-seat elections term limits increase the rotation of power….The probability of a rotation of power is five times more likely in the House and nearly three times more likely in the Senate in an open election than in an election with an incumbent. Thus, incumbency advantage has an enormous impact on party rotation. Term limits, in fact, were historically referred to as the “rotary system” or the principle of “rotation in office” (Benton 1854, Petracca 1992). From this perspective the benefit of term limits is not the termination or limitation of current politicians but rather the expectation that new politicians will rotate into power. The conflict theory does not connect support for term limits with dissatisfaction with current politicians and, in the conflict theory, voting against current politicians is not a substitute for term limits.\n\n…The conflict theory implies that the more political conflict there is in a region the greater the demand for term limits.\n\nPrevious post: Making American Great Again–The FDA\n\nNext post: Assorted Tuesday links","description":"President-elect Trump wants to impose term limits on Congress–that would take a highly unlikely constitutional amendment but highly unlikely things do happen occasionally.

Critics argue that such efforts can erode standards that are in place to protect patients from drugs that don’t work and might even be harmful.\n\n“The language … is industry code for deregulation and reducing of safety standards,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog.\n\nThere is plenty of evidence that the FDA is too slow (see, for example, here, here, here and here) so I would support such a move. Senators Cruz and Lee proposed a reciprocity bill last term under which drugs approved in other developed countries would quickly be approved here; perhaps such a bill could find renewed interest in a Trump administration (Economists also support the idea of reciprocity.)\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has expressed support for Medicare being allowed to negotiate drug prices which is tantamount to price controls given the size of Medicare and that is potentially a disaster. Price controls could significantly reduce research and development in the pharmaceutical industry and end up greatly adding to the invisible graveyard.

Things such as health, security and innovation, which lead to high levels of support amongst Republicans – yes, Republicans – for harnessing the power of American water, wind and sun.\n\nThose federal tax credits for wind and solar? They were passed last December by a Republican Congress with bipartisan support. Revoking them would require a legislative effort that may not be looked upon kindly by the many Republican lawmakers who have renewable energy manufacturing and development in their states. Lawmakers like Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, who said this summer: “If he wants to do away with it, he’ll have to get a bill through Congress, and he’ll do it over my dead body.” He won’t be the only one: looking across the country – and the electoral map – the top-10 wind-energy producing congressional districts are represented by Republicans.\n\nBesides, much of the renewable energy boom has been driven by state policy. You might recall that back when he was governor of Texas, George W. Bush passed legislation requiring utilities to buy renewable energy.\n\nIt led to a building boom that has made the state the largest producer of wind power in the United States. Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma and North Dakota lead the United States in the proportion of electricity generated by wind, and all are led by Republican governors. Ditto North Carolina, which trails only California in the development of new solar projects.\n\nUp in New Hampshire, which also went for Mr. Trump, the newly elected Republican governor won on a platform that included support for the Northern Pass transmission line, which would move clean hydroelectricity from Quebec into New Hampshire and the New England power grid.\n\n…Down in Florida, as Floridians delivered their support to Trump, they also voted to maintain unlimited opportunities for the expansion of rooftop solar. There are hundreds of state-level policies in red states and blue states that aren’t going to disappear, and they are driving significant investment in clean energy.\n\nJust last year, the United States saw $56-billion (U.S.) in clean-energy investment, second only to China. That kind of investment creates a lot of jobs: Almost 210,000 Americans are now employed in the solar industry, double the 2010 figures. This represents more people than those employed in oil and gas extraction. The U.S. Bureau of Labor notes that wind turbine technician is the fastest-growing occupation in the country. Would Mr. Trump put these good jobs in jeopardy? Doubtful.\n\nLooking at dollars and cents – and customers’ wallets – it’s also worth highlighting that the unsubsidized cost of wind and solar just keeps falling, down 61 per cent and 82 per cent respectively, between 2009 and 2015.","description":"The reality is that clean energy has been booming in the United States for a whole bunch of reasons that don’t have much to do with climate change.

For instance, a lot of U.S. workers are producing organizational capital. They work on business plans, building client lists, developing marketing strategies, cultivating customer relations and performing other future-oriented activities common to service-sector enterprises. On any given day, most of us are not churning out additional widgets.\n\nGovernment stimulus, on the other hand, usually is oriented toward concrete outputs such as roads and bridges or military hardware. It’s more like old-style manufacturing.\n\nStimulus therefore pulls workers out of producing organizational capital. In the short run, measured GDP goes up, yet the economy may or may not be doing better overall, especially in the longer run.\n\nAnd this:\n\nIn Keynesian theory, fiscal policy only works well if you use it in down times and pay off the bill during a boom. Trump seems ready to do the opposite by upping spending as the economy approaches full employment. After that? Recent history suggests that many countries switch back to austerity precisely when they shouldn’t. That is a reality proponents of “spend more now” have to reckon with, and it means stimulus can bring a bigger contraction in the future than the boost it gives today.\n\nFor years, I have been reading about evidence that the 2009 fiscal stimulus promoted by the administration of President Barack Obama was good for the American economy. Study after study shows that it boosted GDP across a two- to three-year time horizon, as indeed it did. Furthermore, some parts of the stimulus truly were beneficial, for instance the aid to state and local governments that limited the need for temporary layoffs. But a serious evaluation of the Obama stimulus, and its longer-term consequences, remains to be done.\n\nThere is much more at the link.\n\nPrevious post: Music apps are for the birds\n\nNext post: Trump probably won’t much reverse the current clean energy policies","description":"That is my recent Bloomberg column, here is one bit: Measured GDP just doesn’t capture the relevant trade-offs for evaluating government spending.

Shares have lost half their value this year, including a 3% walloping Wednesday, making the New York-based insurer the worst-performing big stock in the market. The supposedly smart money is having second thoughts, and AIG’s\n\naig\n\naccounting, never exactly a strong suit, is being questioned again in an unwelcome blast from the past.\n\nEven when the government manages to claw back some of the $182 billion it offered up to bail the insurer out, there’s a hitch. An offering that was supposed to bring taxpayers a nice bonus for all their support the past three years turned into a bit of a white-knuckle ride Tuesday. Treasury did cut its stake to 74%, but it sold less stock than initially expected at a barely break-even price.\n\nYet if you look close enough you see signs that AIG may have turned a corner on the road to recovery. AIG’s No. 2 executive, Peter Hancock, told analysts on a conference call this month that the company was done writing new policies for the sake of puffing up its revenue numbers.\n\n“To some extent we are moving away from any kind of top-line targeting,” Hancock said. “We think that leads you to do business at the margin which is unattractive, so the top line will be what it will be. We think it will grow at about 6% based on our best estimates, but we are really instead targeting risk-adjusted profitability.”\n\nDeciding to target risk-adjusted profitability rather than revenue is not exactly rocket science. But remember, this is AIG we’re talking about. It is the outfit that infamously blew up by writing credit default swaps without ever considering it might have to pay out on them.\n\nDavid Merkel, an investor who is the principal at Aleph Investments in Baltimore and a leading chronicler of the AIG saga, says he hasn’t bought any AIG stock but may start taking another look at the company if it shows further signs of having returned to the straight and narrow.\n\n“The best insurance companies focus on underwriting, and I find it encouraging that that’s what you are starting to hear out of AIG,” says Merkel.\n\nQuestionable underwriting hasn’t been AIG’s only problem by a long shot. It has long had a reputation of making its reported numbers look better by underreserving for future claims – a history Merkel has tracked in some depth.\n\nThe impression that the company has spent years cutting corners wasn’t dispelled when AIG said in February it would take a $4 billion hit to profits to strengthen its property-casualty claims-paying resources.\n\nThe question now is “whether $4 billion fills the hole – or does it just fill this year’s hole?” asks Merkel. “The book of business is so complex at AIG that I just can’t tell.”\n\nSo it’s early yet to dive into this murky water, which stands to be choppy as the government tries to extricate itself from its biggest, most widely criticized bailout. Holding three-quarters of a struggling company at a time when people are shouting every day that the stock market is vastly overvalued cannot be a totally reassuring feeling.\n\nBut if the books turn out to be sound and Hancock, a longtime veteran of JPMorgan Chase\n\njpm\n\n, keeps sending the right message, the government’s breakeven sale of its first round of AIG stock needn’t be an albatross.\n\n“I’m going to look at some more bread crumbs,” Merkel says, “but if they lead in the right direction it might be time” to buy the world’s most hated stock.","description":"Could it be time to start kicking the tires on AIG?

If Europe’s central bankers accept this fact, they aren’t showing it.\n\nTake the ECB’s decision this month to oppose a restructuring of Greek debt. By now everyone who isn’t employed in a policymaking role acknowledges that Greece’s finances are unsustainable and getting worse. Even some politicians are coming around.\n\nAs Ireland’s post-bailout death spiral makes clear, austerity alone simply is not going to do the trick. Balancing a budget that is as out of whack as Greece’s “has been known to cause riots if done in a single year,” warns Paolo Manasse, an economics professor at the University of Bologna.\n\nYet officials at the ECB insist the alternative — inflicting losses on bondholders who until recently were all too happy to foot the bills for the big, fat Greek consumption party — is still too damaging to even contemplate. Taking a book out of the Tim Geithner playbook, ECB board member Juergen Stark last week called a possible restructuring a “catastrophe” because it would do bad things to the banks.\n\nMeanwhile the real catastrophe plays out before our eyes. Every day that goes by without a restructuring that forces investors to share European taxpayers’ pain, the ultimate cleanup tab rises. You only have to survey the mess that is the U.S. housing market — or the wreck that once was the Irish economy — to see how that movie ends.\n\n“You cannot really afford to keep buying time, because it is so expensive,” says Daniel Gros, who runs the Center for European Policy Studies think tank in Brussels. “Paying out 100% to existing bondholders is just too big a burden to bear in this situation.”\n\nDevising a workable restructuring isn’t simply a matter of throwing a switch, but it’s not impossible either. Gros has been calling for months for policymakers to cook up a rational restructuring program. The market fully expects the holders of bonds issued by Greece, Ireland and Portugal to recoup far less than 100 cents on the euro when repayment time comes. Why not hold investors to that view?\n\nHere is where politics start to intervene. The ECB holds hundreds of billions of euros of exposure to the weaker economies, and thinly capitalized European banks hold billions more. Like the Fed before it, the ECB is sensitive in part because it has staked so much on a muddle-through view that is implausible without costly subsidies to the banks’ creditors. And even if the ECB concedes it has to take the hit sooner or later, the decision is not its alone to make.\n\n“This is Jean-Claude Trichet’s frustration,” says Gros, referring to the ECB chief (pictured above). “He knows Berlin will not go for a restructuring, so preparations are not taking place.”\n\nIf anything that is an understatement. This week the spreads widened on bonds issued by countries previously resistant to the euro plague, Spain and Italy. This implies the problem is spreading, even as the Greeks get ready to take another round of checks.\n\n“It is hard to acknowledge if you are Trichet that a country can fail,” says Gros. “But the longer this goes on, the greater the chance you find yourself stumbling into something like the weekends Paulson became famous for.”\n\nIf the ECB has been weak, European leaders look little better. They are so cowed by the threat of debt market contagion that some admit they are willing to baldly lie just to smooth the waters for a day or two. Euro area President Jean-Claude Juncker said last month he is willing to mislead the public if the price in terms of market stability is right.\n\nConsidering that Greece’s problems started in earnest when it came to light it had lied about its debt and deficit numbers, this is quite an ironic position for European officialdom to take.\n\n“When it becomes serious, you have to lie,” Juncker said. Either that, or you have to get serious. No prizes for guessing which course Europe will choose.","description":"Should the guys at the European Central Bank have to sit through a screening of “Too Big to Fail”?

The so-called problem bank list rose by just four institutions to 888, FDIC chief Sheila Bair said.\n\nThat’s still the highest number in  two decades and the highest ratio since 1987 as a share of existing banks. It’s a fact that Bair, who is leaving in July after five years on the job, is painfully aware of. When she took the helm at the FDIC in 2006, profits were at a record and the problem banking list comprised just 50 institutions.\n\n“Some will refer to that period as a golden age of banking,” she said, but “with the benefit of hindsight we now know that a substantial part of those record profits were illusory.”\n\nThe profits are coming back now, but in some ways they are just as questionable. Banks posted their biggest quarterly profit since the credit bubble burst in the first quarter, earning $29 billion in the first quarter. That is biggest number since a $36 billion profit in the second quarter of 2007.\n\nBut as has been the case in recent quarters, the main driver of bank profitability was not revenue growth but the release of loan loss reserves. Banks took $31 billion worth of loss provisions and turned them into profits in the latest quarter, Bair said.\n\nSo-called reserve releases are legitimate but unsustainable, and point to even more pressure on bank profits till the economy turns around and loan balances start to grow.\n\n“There is a limit to how far reductions and loan loss provisions can be in industry earnings,” Bair said. “At some point if banks are to continue to increase their profitability, they will have to grow their revenue.”\n\nMeanwhile, loan balances dropped at their fastest clip since the end of 2009, marking their 10th decline in 11 quarters. They dropped at banks both big and small, in what Bair said was a sign of both questionable bank decisionmaking and a weak economy producing soft loan demand.\n\n“Loan balances are down at the smaller banks in the quarter, and they need to make loans to make money,” Bair said. “That’s the business model and they are having trouble finding creditworthy borrowers.”\n\nEven if this quarter does mark the peak on the problem bank list, it’s going to be a very long time before we see another reading in the double digits.","description":"The zombie banking industry took another half step forward Tuesday.

That works out to an average paycheck of $19 million a year – this in a decade in which the biggest banks ripped off everyone in sight on their way to very nearly turning the lights out on the U.S. economy. Well played.\n\nIf the banks’ customers and U.S. taxpayers were the biggest losers, shareholders weren’t far behind. Say you plowed $100 into a market-weighted basket of shares in Bank of America\n\nbac\n\n, JPMorgan Chase\n\njpm\n\n, Citigroup\n\nc\n\n, Wells Fargo\n\nwfc\n\n, Goldman Sachs\n\nGS\n\nand Morgan Stanley\n\nms\n\non Jan. 1, 2001. How much would you have had by the end of last year?\n\nThe answer is a princely $81.60, according to an analysis by Kevin Kelly of Capital IQ in Denver. Even a buyer of the S\u0026P 500 at the start of stocks’ lost decade would have $115. Imagine the sums these wise bankers could command if they ever did right by anyone but themselves!\n\nThe winners in this zero-sum game are, naturally, the guys who move other people’s money around to such effect. They are led by CEOs Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Dick Kovacevich, who led Wells Fargo till 2007.\n\nEven by the standards of the bailout age, the sums they have taken down are mindboggling. Blankfein, paragon of self-denial, has scraped by on $233 million since taking over as CEO for Hank Paulson in 2004. Dimon, known as banking’s golden boy for good reason, has subsisted on $177 million since replacing William Harrrison in 2003.  Kovacevich, evidently as much an ascetic as a loudmouth banker, eked out a living on a miserly $97.5 million between 2001 and 2007 before giving way to John Stumpf. How tough it is nowadays to make ends meet!\n\nWhat’s most absurd is that these are, for the purposes of this discussion, the good guys. Shareholders in those three banks actually made a little money over the past decade (see chart, right), if not enough to justify these sums – and not without trillions of dollars of help from the U.S. taxpayer.\n\nIt is hard to muster any such defense, however half-hearted, for the proud chieftains of the other big banks. All three have lost shareholders gobs of money over the past decade – in Citi’s\n\nc\n\ncase, nearly all of it — even as they took tens of billions of dollars of bailout funds.\n\nThis rogue’s gallery includes Ken Lewis, who was forced out of Bank of America after taking $150 million of shareholder money between 2001 and 2009; John Mack, who received $118 million for overseeing a majestic 25% decline in Morgan Stanley’s stock price; and the immortal Chuck Prince, who took $113 million over four short years as he waltzed Citigroup to the brink of insolvency.\n\nThe good news, such as it is, is that all three of those losers have been shown the door by now. Whether their replacements represent any improvement remains to be seen, however.\n\nTake Citi, where the board this month gave Vikram Pandit a retention package worth at least $22 million (and perhaps double that) after he oversaw an 87% stock price plunge that stopped short of zero only because Tim Geithner bought that line about the banks being the heart of the economy. Part of the argument in favor of this curious arrangement, supposedly, was Pandit’s unparalleled sacrifice in having taken a dollar in salary for the previous year and a half.\n\nBut emphasizing that Pandit was earning $1 a year “is disingenuous since it ignores the $38 million of pay in 2008 and the $165 million he received in 2007 for Citi’s purchase of the CEO’s hedge fund, which has since been closed due to performance and outflows,” writes CLSA analyst Mike Mayo.\n\nThere is also the curious case of Brian Moynihan, who took over after Lewis got a long overdue ax in late 2009. You’d think it would be hard to do worse than the guy whose last two acts were saddling BofA with the lawsuit magnet Countrywide and the massively overpriced Merrill Lynch. But Moynihan, to his sort of credit, has been so reckless in his promises to do right by shareholders that  he has even roused the somnolent Fed. At least he is making less than Lewis did.\n\nSo now the focus turns to whether the banks are indeed going to ignite a recovery. There is not a lot of evidence so far in their numbers, which show loans shrinking even as deposits flow in, and the economy is not exactly going great guns lately. But hey, imagine the bonuses Dimon and Moynihan and their pals can command when they do eventually start lending.","description":"Has any group ever been more richly rewarded for failure than the CEOs of the six biggest U.S. banks?  Over the past decade the too-big-to-fail banks have showered a staggering $1.","keywords":"finance, street sweep","time":1306248034,"url":"http://fortune.com/2011/05/24/big-bank-ceos-the-billion-dollar-bust/"},{"title":"The silver lining in falling bank stocks","body":"Summer is a month away yet, but the financials are already wilting.

Both BofA and Morgan Stanley are trading substantially below Wells Fargo analyst Matthew Burnell’s estimates of their tangible book value, and Goldman Sachs is trading just above.\n\nThat’s unusual in itself, as banks over the past 20 years traded at an average multiple of 2.6 times tangible book – a rough proxy for the amount a bank might fetch in a fire sale, not that it would ever, ever come to that.\n\nIn any case, the implication is the market doesn’t trust the bankers any more than any of the rest of us. In part that’s because it seems reasonably clear the costs of the banks’ bubble-era misbehavior aren’t going to be neatly tallied any time soon.\n\nThat will, sniff sniff, hold down returns that already are nothing to write home about, except in anger and exasperation.

But persistent global demand, tepid supply growth and easy money mean it may not be long till the next damaging spike, Goldman Sachs economists say.\n\nOil prices could surge again by the end of 2012, economists Jan Hatzius and Andrew Tilton wrote in a note to clients this past weekend. They say the snail-like pace of global oil supply expansion – which Goldman projects at 1% or so annually – can’t keep a petroleum-addicted world economy rolling without prices rising, perhaps sharply.\n\nSo don’t get too used to paying a mere $3 and change for gasoline. Higher prices are on the way soon enough, thanks to stretched supplies and a Federal Reserve spigot that is likely to remain wide open for years to come.\n\n“The fundamental story of increased oil scarcity is unchanged, and our commodity strategists now see distinct upside risks to their current forecast of $120/barrel for Brent crude by late 2012,” Hatzius and Tilton write. “So the impact of scarcer oil and higher oil prices on economic activity remains at the top of our list of worries.”\n\nWhat makes higher oil prices almost inevitable is the depth of the jobs deficit in the United States. Unemployment is officially 9% but is more like 13% if you consider the low rate of labor force participation, says Bernstein Research strategist Vadim Zlotnikov. That number has fallen this year to levels not seen since 1985.\n\nHigh joblessness and weak inflation will keep the fed funds rate near zero at least through next year and perhaps longer, Hatzius and Tilton write. That should help keep pushing unemployment slowly toward its long-run average of around 6% — but at the expense of further dollar depreciation, stronger global demand and, ultimately, higher oil prices.\n\nSo the selloff that has taken the crude price down to $100 or so in New York and $112 in Europe, where Brent is traded, may persist through much of 2011. But it won’t last forever, Goldman warns.\n\n“The only way to bring both the labor market and the oil market into equilibrium is likely to be through a further increase in the real oil price,” the Goldman economists write. “This would presumably increase oil supply by making exploration and production more attractive, and reduce oil demand by increasing energy efficiency.”\n\nThey add that this policy trade-off is often unfairly portrayed as transferring income from the poor to the rich. The Goldman economists concede that those in the bottom fifth of the U.S. income distribution spend more of their funds on gas than do those in the top fifth, by 4.6% to 3.5%.\n\nBut they note that those losses by the poorest consumers are offset by the job creation enabled by the loose Fed policy, which “will lead to significant gains in real income for a subset of households drawn disproportionately from the lower end of the income distribution.”\n\nAnd while no one is likely to turn cartwheels about higher oil prices, Hatzius and Tilton point out that there’s an obvious way for the United States to turn that trend in its favor: By imposing higher taxes on energy use.\n\nIn doing so the government could both hold down consumption (through higher prices) and boost federal revenues (which could use some boosting nowadays, you may have noticed), mostly at the expense of foreign governments that are at best our frenemies. But needless to say, something that makes that much sense has about as much chance of seeing daylight in the current Congress as the return of dollar-a-gallon gas.","description":"How long till the next oil shock?

They contend that global central bankers are about to spring off the sidelines to buy Treasury debt, in what stands to be the latest setback for the Pimco bond fund manager’s giant bet against U.S. government bonds.\n\nSince the Fed’s latest round of bond buying started last November, BofA says, cash — mostly in the form of dollars — has been piling up in places like Brazil and India as money rushes toward faster-growing economies, in the form of trade surpluses as well as Fed-fueled capital inflows.\n\nBut in a familiar refrain, the bankers getting deluged by this money torrent have been sitting on their hands. Foreign exchange reserves held as bank deposits recently hit their highest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, BofA says, while the ratio of securities held for each unit of bank deposits has been dropping back to its post-panic low. What’s more, the pace of foreign official Treasury accumulation slowed sharply in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere is, in short, a good deal of pent-up demand for Treasury bonds — which is why BofA strategist Priya Misra sees solid support for the U.S. government bond market even after the Fed kicks its $75 billion-a-month habit.\n\n“We believe the most likely explanation is that some reserve managers are awaiting the end of QE to put cash to work in the Treasury market, perhaps driven by the belief that rates are being kept artificially low by the Fed’s steady buying,” writes Misra.\n\nThe fog of foreign reserve data means that it’s impossible to say for sure what is going on with the central bankers. That goes particularly for the mandarins perched atop the elephant in this room, China (which controls a third of the world’s $9.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves).\n\nEven so, there are some clear signs that the Fed’s decision to support the U.S. economy with a flood of dollar liquidity caused some behavioral changes among the globe’s other dollar accumulators, from Indonesia and Poland to Japan and Russia.\n\n“Beginning in November 2010 some of these central banks began to put a sizable amount of new cash into deposits at official institutions such as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and, to a lesser extent, at commercial banks,” Misra writes. “Note that this marks the first sustained increase in deposits since the onset of the financial crisis.”\n\nOf course, as much as you might like your friendly local banker at the Bank of International Settlements, no one likes collecting 0.1% annually at a time when inflation is on the march. That’s why BofA expects foreign reserve managers to start marching back into the Treasury market — particularly in two-to-seven-year notes, all of which are being auctioned next week.\n\nDemand for Treasury debt has been picking up anyway, thanks to slowdown signs in the U.S. economy and the fear that Europe’s debt crisis is about to spiral out of control again. But unless Congress goes through with its threat to blow up the country in a stupid fight over the debt ceiling, lower Treasury yields look like a pretty good bet for the rest of 2011.","description":"Do central bankers have it in for the world's most widely cited Treasury bond bear?

You may soon have more relief than you’d like.\n\nAfter two commodity price spikes in four years, $100-a-barrel crude and $4-a-gallon gasoline are starting to seem like the new normal — the price we pay, unhappily enough, for an expanding economy. Every twitch in the Middle East sounds the alarm for a new oil shock.\n\nBut those cursing the wallet-thinning impact of high energy prices should be careful what they wish for. Sagging economic expectations, after all, are the likeliest route to lower energy costs, as we have seen with the recent decline in oil prices.\n\nRetail gas prices haven’t come down much yet, averaging $3.91 a gallon at last check — a sign, says oil watcher Richard Soultanian, that “maybe even the refiners don’t trust the pullback in crude prices.” But if current trends continue, the pullback could go further than people expect.\n\nThere are plenty of signs economic growth is slowing. U.S. gasoline demand has fallen more than 2% over the past year, suggesting that high prices have already started to weigh on the economy. Uber-bear David Rosenberg cites recent declines in architectural billings, small business optimism, house price and manufacturing indexes. Goldman Sachs strategists note that while manufacturing employment has rebounded, recent gains are proceeding at just a quarter of the pace of the average monthly manufacturing job loss (a depressing 52,000) over the past decade.\n\nBetter late than never, economists everywhere are cutting economic growth forecasts that started 2011 in the 4% range – if probably not as much as they should. The wishful thinking impulse dies hard.\n\n“Everyone’s demand and GDP forecasts for the next six to 12 months are just way overblown,” says Soultanian, whose NUS Consulting in Park Ridge, N.J., helps big companies plan for energy price shifts. “I think there is quite a good chance we will be revisiting $80-$85 oil by year-end.”\n\nThat forecast, mind you, presumes that the economy continues to limp along at a 2%-3% annual clip. But with the Federal Reserve scheduled to end its bond-buying program next month and federal support for overstretched state budgets ending as well this spring, a half-hearted U.S. expansion looks considerably more vulnerable than it did coming into 2011.\n\nFiscal tightening and monetary neutrality are hardly shocking developments, of course. But talk of the Fed heading for the exit ignores the impact of higher energy prices themselves. One rule of thumb has it that the economy goes into recession after the oil price triples — which it has done since its 2008 panic low.\n\nAnd though almost no one talks about the dreaded double-dip recession any more, the soft data and the many shocks we have already taken this year, from the Mideast unrest to the Japanese tsunami, should remind us we are hardly out of those woods.\n\n“I don’t see how we’re going to fill the vacuum” of all the federal money that has been pumped into the economy, says Soultanian. “That doesn’t mean you end up in a recession, but the chances are a lot higher than people appreciate. Maybe 25%?”\n\nIt is impossible to say how far oil prices might drop in a substantial U.S. slowdown, of course. A plunge to the 2008 lows seems implausible, but then until a few months ago so did a return to $4 gasoline.\n\nIn any case, a slowdown stands to undermine the fragile jobs recovery that Ben Bernanke has staked so much on. And the higher unemployment goes, the more people will be apt to remember that a little inflation pressure, as unpleasant as it is, beats the alternative.","description":"Sick of high energy prices?

Practically alone among big holders of the stock, Goldman decided to dump it all in Thursday’s debut, selling its entire 871,840-share stake at the IPO price of $45 a share. What gives?\n\nGoldman declined to comment, and it’s not like the firm is taking a bath by selling out. Goldman stands to make something on the order of $34 million by selling the LinkedIn shares at the IPO price, three years after it bought the shares. In mid-2008 LinkedIn was paying $5.56 a share to buy back stock from its chief technology officer, so it stands to reason Goldman’s per-share profit on this deal is around $39.\n\nYet Thursday’s blastoff says Goldman could have made even more. The firm’s supposed to excel at this sort of value-maximizing activity, after all. And even if LinkedIn’s valuation is on the bubbly side, the massive for the stock this week seems to suggest that particular bubble is in no danger of imminent collapse.\n\nOr is it? Goldman may be banking on a replay of this month’s other hot IPO, the May 4 debut of Chinese social networking company Renren\n\nrenn\n\n. Its shares jumped more than 70% (see chart, right) when trading started, topping out at $24 early on their first day after pricing at $14.\n\nBut how quickly the Renren craze faded. The stock dropped 25% from its peak on opening day to close at $18, then dropped in each of the next six trading sessions before bottoming out at $12.60, 10% below the IPO price. The stock was up 4% in Thursday’s social networking party but is only just above $14.\n\nLinkedIn mania may well last longer than Renren’s run did. But it’s easy enough to see the case for selling any stock that is trading, as LinkedIn is at a recent $108.55, at 666 times earnings.","description":"Is Wall Street’s savviest trading firm leaving a LinkedIn fortune on the table?

It signed Pandit to a deal that will hand him more than $20 million in retention payments as long as the bank doesn’t blow up.\n\nThat’s in addition to whatever compensation he’ll earn in normal course. The board this year boosted his salary to $1.75 million after a year and change at an outrage-placating $1.\n\nPredictably, Citi painted the awards as having been earned through stellar performance.\n\n“Vikram has done an outstanding job since coming on board as the financial crisis began,” chairman Dick Parsons said. “Under his leadership, the management team has navigated Citi through the crisis, returned Citi to profitability and is executing a strategy for sustainable growth.”\n\nBut Pandit was able to navigate Citi through the crisis mostly because Tim Geithner et al. decided that propping up the banks at all costs would lead to a faster recovery. And while the government made a $12 billion profit on the Citi bailout, it is clear that taking that course had its pluses and minuses.\n\nIt’s impossible to say for sure what would have happened if the government had taken the likes of Citi to the cleaners, throwing out management and all. But with the banks still shrinking their loan books at a time when unemployment is at 9%, it is hard to make the argument the decision was a winner for taxpayers.\n\nThings sure worked out well for Pandit and his cronies, though. Under the incentive plan Citi adopted this year for its top five executives, the bank stands to hand out $18 million in pay if Citi simply stays on its current profit track, which has so wowed investors that the bank recently resorted to a 1-for-10 reverse stock split.\n\nAnd he’ll get 500,000 stock options, mostly at the recent stock price of $41 and change — which itself represents a 10% or so decline from this time last month.

But inviting further mockery, the airline explained that the numbers had been “inadvertently reinstated” into United’s systems as they are merged with those of its newly acquired sister airline, Continental.

Wait till 2025.\n\nThat’s the message behind a World Bank report this week that imagines what the global economy will look like in a decade and a half. It is, to be blunt, a world in which Americans have sold everything that isn’t nailed down to finance our fabulous lifestyles.\n\nYes, the United States will still have the biggest economy, and the dollar is likely to continue to play a prominent if probably reduced reserve-currency role. But Americans will find themselves paying for those exorbitant privileges, and how.\n\nThe World Bank projects that while the U.S. economy will expand by perhaps 40% in constant dollar terms, net foreign ownership of U.S. assets – stocks, bonds and property in the hands mostly of China and other emerging Asian countries — will expand fivefold. This is the ownership society, though with others doing the owning.\n\nThe U.S. net international investment position – which compares the value of foreign-owned U.S. assets with the value of U.S.-owned foreign assets — will hit a staggering minus-69% of annual gross domestic product by 2025, in the World Bank scenario. That compares with minus-18% now.\n\nIf you accept the World Bank’s view, by 2025 the rest of the world will own something on the order of $13 trillion more of U.S. assets than we own of theirs. China alone will hold an $8 trillion investment surplus against the rest of the world, mostly the United States.\n\nThose sums dwarf the deficits the United States has run up even in its past two decades of profligacy. It had a $2.7 trillion (see chart, right) negative international investment position as of 2009, the last date for which figures are available. If anything that understates the degree to which America has been living on borrowed money: U.S. current account deficits over the past two decades add up to almost $7 trillion, but we made much of that back on valuation changes (thanks to factors such as an ever-weakening dollar).\n\nIt wasn’t too long ago that a mere $2 trillion or so in net foreign ownership of U.S. assets was viewed as something to fret over. Warren Buffett did so in the pages of Fortune in November 2003, at a time when the trade deficit was just starting to blow out and the dollar was on the verge of paying the price.\n\nHe compared the U.S. practice of running 12-digit trade deficits for the purpose of financing domestic consumption to “an extraordinarily rich family that possesses an immense farm. In order to consume 4% more than we produce — that’s the trade deficit — we have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own.”\n\nBuffett made that point in the service of arguing for a policy to limit imports and encourage exports. Congress, predictably, did nothing. Since then, the trade-weighted dollar index has dropped 20% and imports have risen by half. Coincidence?\n\nNo one has any earthly idea what the global economy is going to look like in 2025, of course. But it’s easy to see why predicting more dollar depreciation and U.S. irresponsibility is not a very hard sale nowadays.","description":"Think we’re in hock up to our eyeballs now? Wait till 2025.

LinkedIn is expected to go public this week at a price above $40 a share. That’s a far cry from the $2.32 a share the networking-for-professionals outfit valued itself at as recently as the spring of 2009.\n\nThat said, the company admits in offering documents that it has moved the goalposts at least once in estimating what its shares are worth. That nifty move, you’ll be shocked to learn, stands to benefit insiders such as LinkedIn’s founders and executives at the expense of those buying in at the inflated IPO price. Does any of this sound familiar?\n\nLinkedIn is looking to sell shares at between $42 and $45 each this week. An IPO that prices in that range would value the company, which made $15 million last year, at $4.1 billion. That’s 267 times earnings if you’re keeping score at home.\n\nIt is not too hard to make the case that this valuation puts LinkedIn and its social networking peers firmly in bubble territory. But it’s interesting all the same to watch the bubble inflate month by month, which LinkedIn allows us to do in a section of its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThat document contains a section that explains how the San Francisco-based company’s board decided to price the $611 million worth of stock options it granted employees in LinkedIn over the past two and a half years.\n\nWhen the company granted options in February 2009, for instance, it valued them at $2.32 a share. It maintained that price in three subsequent grants that year. Among the factors in those valuations, LinkedIn said, were “continued weakness in our business” and “uncertainty surrounding the U.S. and global economies.”\n\nBut as business picked up and the economy started to recover, the company raised the strike price to $3.50 that September. It maintained that price for the rest of 2009, before citing improving revenue growth, strengthening financial markets and the increasing likelihood of an IPO for seven grant-price increases in 2010 and 2011.\n\nEven after all those increases, the company said a “contemporaneous valuation of our common stock as of March 17, 2011” put the value at just $22.59 a share — barely half the expected offering price specified in the latest filing this month.\n\nThe company, eager to explain away that rather large gap, now attributes it at least in part to the use of a substantially different set of comparable companies to determine our price range as compared to the comparable companies utilized in our valuation report. Specifically, the comparable company analysis used to determine our anticipated offering price range focused more on Internet businesses that have similar rates of growth as we do, rather than smaller companies that do not share these characteristics.\n\nThat is to say, LinkedIn is either A) using actual comparable companies now after previously choosing dogs to justify its underpriced stock option grants, or B) using hyped-up comparisons now in order to justify the bubbly market-will-bear price. Which do you prefer? A spokesman didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nIn any case, there is one characteristic that practically all IPO companies share, and here LinkedIn is no exception: A desire to enrich insiders at the expense of public offering buyers. Be very careful indeed before you accept the invitation to join the LinkedIn investor club.","description":"Would you believe the value of LinkedIn has risen 19-fold in just over two years?

The U.K. economy contracted in the fourth quarter and barely expanded in the first, as the effects of the government’s belt-tightening hammered spending and pushed up prices via higher taxes.\n\n“It is now clear that underlying activity growth slowed markedly around the turn of the year,” BoE governor Mervyn King said last week. “Looking through the volatility associated with heavy snow last December, the level of output appears to have been broadly flat over the past two quarters, and remains about 4% below its peak prior to the crisis.”\n\nSo for now U.K. consumers, like their counterparts here and for that matter around the debt-soaked Western economies, are feeling the sting of higher prices without any offset from a hiring boom or surging wages.

He is expected to resign soon. Guys who can’t get bail aren’t much use when it comes to bailing out others, after all, and propping up debt-soaked states like Greece, Ireland and Portugal is what the IMF does nowadays.\n\nThat said, if you’re waiting for Strauss-Kahn’s fall to throw a wrench into Europe’s extend-and-pretend machine, you’re probably going to be waiting a long time.\n\nBailout decisions “are ultimately a European political question,” says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The working relationship between those countries and the IMF is so entrenched at this point that it’s hard to imagine this causing much more than a hiccup.”\n\nThe bigger impact of Saturday’s alleged incident lies in the shift of economic leadership from the debt-soaked West to the emerging East – an accelerating trend that is almost certain to manifest itself in who gets chosen to pick up the pieces left by Strauss-Kahn.\n\nThe head of the IMF traditionally comes from Europe, just as the head of the World Bank has hailed from the United States. But the developing countries whose expansion now accounts for the lion’s share of economic growth have been chafed by their exclusion from those roles — and this weekend’s events are going to make upholding those traditions, such as they are, that much more difficult.\n\n“Only a truly exceptional European candidate can have the credibility to replace Strauss-Kahn,” says Kirkegaard. “The changes in the world economy mean the IMF needs to be truly global, and that has implications for who takes over next.”\n\nHe views the sole plausible European candidate as Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister. She has “unique qualifications,” including potentially being the first woman in an office that up till now has been held only by men.\n\nBut developing countries led by China, India and Brazil now have an opportunity, if they can settle on a suitable nominee, to wrest leadership from the West.\n\nKirkegaard says the top IMF candidates from the developing world include Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who is Singapore’s finance minister, Kemal Dervis, a Turk who is at the Brookings Institution, and Augustin Carstens, who runs the Bank of Mexico.\n\n“Of course, you have the question if a candidate backed by China would ever be acceptable toIndia, and vice versa,” says Kirkegaard. “The onus is on them to find someone they can unite behind.”\n\nThe IMF chief’s job isn’t the only one that’s going to be open. The No. 2 post at the fund, currently held by American John Lipsky, will be up for grabs in August, after Lipsky departs, and the World Bank chairmanship held now by American Robert Zoellick will soon open up as well.\n\nThe internationalization of international finance institutions is inevitable, of course. If Westerners are expecting Brazil and China to pick up the slack for our weak economies, we will have to give up something in return.\n\nNow the question is whether the emerging countries handle this opportunity better than they dealt with the commodity price surge that started last fall. Brazil and especially China had a huge role in that affair – yet they unsportingly chose to point the finger at Ben Bernanke.\n\nThat sounds more like the nonsense you hear out of Congress than the actions of leaders ready to take a whirl at the helm of the global economy. With any luck they will do better this time.","description":"Welcome to the post-crisis era, International Monetary Fund.

Billions","body":"It's been just over a week since Donald Trump won the general election, and investors are still trying to figure out what a Trump administration holds in store for their positions. That's much easier said than done, considering the fact that the president-elect hasn't been particularly forthright with detailed plans on any of his proposed policies. One issue that Trump campaigned on was his support of alleviating taxes on repatriating cash, arguing that allowing corporations to bring funds home at favorable tax rates would translate into domestic investment that would in turn spur economic activity stateside. Of course, that was the argument for the last repatriation holiday in 2004, and most of the cash that companies brought back was promptly returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. There are valid arguments for and against a repatriation holiday, but most lawmakers are against repatriation holidays because the government ends up losing tax revenue over the long-term; the holidays simply encourage more profit shifting as companies just wait around hoping for the next repatriation holiday. Trump's site from his campaign calls for relief: \"It will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.\" This is a slightly higher rate than the 2004 holiday, which allowed companies to repatriate cash at 5.25%. It's worth noting that Trump's site after becoming president-elect does not include details on repatriation, so it's not clear where Trump currently stands on this issue. You may have noticed that I didn't refer to Trump's proposal as a \"holiday.\" It's a minor semantic distinction, but it's important. There are three broad ways that lawmakers have proposed dealing with foreign cash hoards, which now total approximately $2.6 trillion. There is a transition tax, a stand-alone deemed repatriation, or a repatriation tax holiday. Deemed repatriation is sort of a hybrid of the other two, so you could arguably apply \"holiday\" to deemed repatriation due to its one-time nature as well. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, provides this handy table: Image source: CBPP . The way that deemed repatriation would work is that the government would impose a one-time tax on all foreign profits that are currently being held overseas. The most important distinction is that unlike a pure holiday, which allows for optional repatriation, deemed repatriation is compulsory and the tax would be imposed regardless of whether or not companies actually brought that cash back. The U.S. government would be able to use the incoming revenue for things like infrastructure, but it doesn't guarantee that companies will actually repatriate cash. But if they're paying the tax anyway, many companies will probably choose to repatriate. Much digital ink has been spilled regarding Apple 's(NASDAQ: AAPL) massive and growing foreign reserves, which now stand at $216 billion. The Mac maker has long tapped the debt markets as a roundabout way to raise domestic cash while avoiding repatriation taxes, funds that it uses to pay dividends and repurchase stock. But that strategy has inherent limits, as Apple has now amassed nearly $80 billion in long-term debt . At the same time, CEO Tim Cook has already stated that Apple is planning on repatriating a large chunk of cash as early as next year, noting that the company has \" provisioned several billion dollars \" for taxes without elaborating further. It seems that some level of repatriation is already on the table for Apple. Using Trump's proposed 10% deemed repatriation rate, Apple could be facing a one-time tax bill of $21.6 billion. That doesn't sound like savings, and whether or not Apple actually saved money depends on how much it was already planning on bringing home. Here are just some theoretical scenarios. Amount Repatriated Status Quo Tax (35%) Deemed Repatriation Savings I've skewed toward higher amounts here on purpose. Under normal circumstances, it's very unlikely that Apple would have been considering repatriating $50 billion or more, and I highly doubt that the amount Cook was thinking of approached $50 billion. But if Trump enacts his deemed repatriation rate of 10%, Apple has an incentive to repatriate more while it still can, as its savings increase in lockstep. It's also unrealistic to think that Apple would repatriate as much as $200 billion, since it still needs foreign reserves to continue expanding its international retail presence as well as capital spending for product tooling and manufacturing infrastructure that resides within partner facilities in Asia. The more that Apple repatriates under this hypothetical scenario, the longer it can fund its capital return program without turning to capital markets. None of this is to suggest that a Trump Administration would be pro-Apple by any means. The president-elect has already demonized Apple's globalization as part of his nationalist-oriented campaign, and a trade war would definitely hurt if Trump goes through with it. But if Trump and a Republican Congress move forward with a deemed repatriation bill, Apple could actually benefit.

The fourth quarter in 2015 benefited from an additional week of operations, compared with this past quarter. The results, however, capped off what's been a great year for the entertainment giant, particularly in its legendary movie-making business. This article's purpose isn't to rehash the results - you can read my take on them here -- but to share key information discussed on the company's analyst conference call . The focus here is on topics not related to cord-cutting, as that issue has been well covered, and beat to death by the financial media in general. Here are four key things investors should know. CFO Christine McCarthy shared what had to be the best news covered on the conference call: [W]e couldn't be more pleased with the launch of Shanghai Disneyland. The financial results for the park's first full quarter of operations [the park opened in mid-June] were ahead of our expectations. As we look to fiscal 2017, we expect Shanghai Disney Resort to be very close to breakeven for the year. CEO Bob Iger added the following about attendance: Turning to our success in Shanghai, we welcomed 4 million guests in our first four months of operation, which included the peak summer season. Iger went on to say that some folks may infer from the park's robust early performance that it could achieve 10 million in attendance in its first year -- a number that the company would be thrilled with -- but Disney isn't providing any annual guidance at this point. To provide some context, the Magic Kingdom park at Disney World had about 20.5 million visitors in 2015, while California's Disneyland had about 18.3 million visitors. So a new park hosting 10 million visitors -- or even a number coming relatively close - would be an amazing accomplishment. Likewise, being very close to financially breaking even for the year in fiscal 2017 would be a major feat, given the park just opened in June. Management believes there is room for more growth in average guest spending at the domestic parks. From Iger's remarks: [W]e believe we still have pricing leverage. And that's not just from raising prices on your standard ticket; it's from creating new packages. And we certainly have seen that in the last year, which was designed to do a few things. One, obviously when we put in more demand-oriented pricing, we're able to move some of the attendance away from the peak period and improve the guest satisfaction. This point is especially important because combined guest attendance at Disney World and Disneyland has been about flat over the last few quarters, usually with a decline at the former being offset by an increase at the latter. This quarter, however, it was the other way around. Beyond believing there's potential for per-guest-spending growth at its parks, Iger said the company has room for expansion on the hotel front, as well. According to him, \"[W]e've seen such high occupancy rates in Orlando and in California, that we believe that it would be smart for us to build up more hotels...\" Lightning McQueen and pals are coming back in June, which should rev up toy and other merchandise sales. Source: Disney. Here's how McCarthy emphatically answered an analyst who asked if the release of Pixar's Cars 3, slated for June, should reaccelerate revenue growth in the consumer products and interactive segment: Absolutely. Cars is one of those evergreen franchises that has been very successful in consumer products. [And] ... throughout our [business] -- it is also represented in our parks, as you know, through Cars Land in Anaheim. And also this year, we have the movie Spider-Man. It's not our movie to release, but our consumer products will represent the strength in that franchise, as well. Spider-Man: Homecoming  is scheduled to be released in July. While it's being distributed by Sony, Disney's Marvel is one of the companies producing the film. And Disney's consumer products business will benefit from the licensing of merchandise based on the movie. With modest growth due to some comparability factors that Christine [McCarthy, the CFO] will detail, fiscal 2017 will be an anomaly in our growth trajectory. While growth is expected to slow in fiscal 2017, Iger said that management anticipates the strong growth dynamics that Disney has enjoyed recently to resume in fiscal 2018. McCarthy outlined why the company expects slower growth in fiscal 2017: Knowing what to expect in fiscal 2017 means investors will be less likely to make poor investing decisions. The good news is that more robust growth is expected to be on the horizon for fiscal 2018.

Already the world's fastest-accelerating car currently in production, it's difficult to imagine the car's 2.5-second zero-to-60 time getting any better. But, according to a tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday, a faster zero-to-60 time is indeed on the way. Model S. Image source: The Motley Fool. \"Looks like the Model S P100D Easter egg will allow it to do 0 to 60 mph in 2.4 sec and a 10.6 sec 1/4 mile via software update next month,\" Musk said. The company's Model X SUV's zero-to-60 and quarter-mile times will also improve by 0.1 seconds, Musk said in another tweet. As an \"Easter egg,\" owners will have to search for a way to unlock the performance boost. Tesla has hidden Easter eggs in its software before, including a Mario Kart-like rainbow road that displays in the dash, a warp-speed-looking 5-second animation on the 17-inch touch screen, among others. This Easter egg, though, is the first to unlock a significant performance enhancement. There are several reasons Tesla software updates like these are notable. First, by delivering a significant performance update for its flagship versions of Model S and Model X, Tesla continues to demonstrate the value its software can bring to its fleet over time. Second, software updates likely also help boost press coverage and word-of-mouth marketing, both of which are particularly important to Tesla since it doesn't pay for advertising. However, it could also be said that investors already expect Tesla to deliver this kind of value to customers, making moves like this more of a requirement at this point rather than a bonus.

Networking hardware giant Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) reported its fiscal first-quarter results after the market closed on Nov. 16. The company's results came in at the high end of its guidance, but Cisco expects the second quarter to be much weaker. Growth areas such as collaboration and the data center suffered declines during the quarter, while security continued to post robust growth. Here's what investors need to know about Cisco's first-quarter results. Cisco Systems results: The raw numbers Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $12.35 billion $12.68 billion (2.6%) Net income $2.32 billion $2.43 billion (4.4%) Non-GAAP EPS $0.61 $0.59 3.4% Data source: Cisco Systems. What happened with Cisco Systems this quarter? Adjusted for the sale of the SP Video CPE business, Cisco's revenue was in line with the high end of its guidance. Adjusted revenue grew by 1% year over year. The switching segment suffered a 7% decline in sales, generating $3.72 billion of revenue. The routing segment produced $2.09 billion of revenue, up 6%. The collaboration segment, which has been growing in recent quarters, suffered a 3% sales decline, with $1.08 billion of revenue. Data center revenue dropped 3% to $834 million. Wireless revenue dropped 2% to $632 million. The security segment continued to grow at a double-digit rate, with revenue of $540 million representing growth of 11%. Service provider video, excluding the SP Video CPE business, slumped 2% to $271 million. Deferred revenue rose 12% year over year to $17 billion, driven by subscription-based software. Cisco's second-quarter guidance fell short of expectations. Revenue is expected to decline by between 2% and 4%, excluding the SP Video CPE business. GAAP EPS expected between $0.42 and $0.47, while non-GAAP EPS expected between $0.55 and $0.57. For the second quarter of last year, non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.57. What management had to say Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins summed up the quarter: We had a good quarter despite a challenging global business environment and we performed well in our priority areas. We are leading our customers in their digital transition by providing them with highly secure, automated, and intelligent solutions in the ways they want to consume them. Our innovation pipeline is robust and we are well positioned for the future. Kelly Kramer, CFO of Cisco, discussed the shift to a subscription model: We executed well in Q1 delivering profitable growth, and saw strong adoption of our subscription-based and software offerings as we transition our business to a more recurring revenue model. We will invest in key growth areas and continue to focus on delivering shareholder value. Looking forward One thing hurting Cisco's results is its ongoing shift toward a subscription business model. The security segment grew revenue by 11% year over year, but deferred revenue soared 39%. While collaboration revenue slumped 3%, deferred revenue jumped 14%. Cisco singles out the growth of software-as-a-service within these segments as one reason for the discrepancy. With only one growth business, security, posting growth during the first quarter, and with guidance for the second quarter calling for a revenue decline, the difficult environment Cisco finds itself in is taking a toll on the company.

But since there's never a shortage of weak stocks to avoid, it's time to add two more names to that list -- Palo Alto Networks (NYSE: PANW) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) . On the surface, next-gen firewall provider Palo Alto Networks looks like a solid growth stock. Revenue rose 41% annually to  $400.8 million last quarter, topping estimates by $11.1 million, and 49% for the full year. However, that growth represented a slowdown from 55% growth in  2015 and 51% growth in  2014. That \"slowdown\" seems tame, but it also makes it harder to justify Palo Alto's price-to-sales ratio of 10. By comparison, its next-gen firewall rival Check Point  and threat prevention firm FireEye  -- which both have lower revenue growth rates -- both trade at 9 times sales. All three companies trade at a premium to the  software industry's average P/S of 5. The core problem with Palo Alto is that its expenses -- particularly stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses for high-paid sales and R\u0026D jobs -- are outpacing its revenue growth. SBC expenses soared 75% last year and consumed 30% of its revenues, causing its GAAP net loss to widen from $165 million to $226 million. The additional shares it's issuing to cover SBC also boosted its share count by 25% over the past three years, diluting existing shares and inflating its multiples. Unless Palo Alto gets its costs under control, it could face cash flow problems in the near future -- so investors should avoid this stock until the company demonstrates better financial discipline. I previously highlighted IBM as a decent income play with a solid forward yield of 3.5%, a sustainable payout ratio of 44%, and a low P/E of 13 -- which is much lower than the industry average of 21 for IT services companies. However, I personally wouldn't want to buy Big Blue for two reasons -- its turnaround plan is painfully slow, and rising interest rates could cause income investors to dump IBM as a dividend play while throttling is ability to use debt-funded buybacks. IBM has  posted 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year revenue declines due to sluggish enterprise spending, competition, and currency headwinds throttling the growth of its IT services, software, and hardware businesses. The company's long-term turnaround plan is to divest weaker businesses while nurturing the growth of its five \"strategic imperatives\" -- cloud, analytics, mobile, security, and social platforms. Revenue from those businesses, which accounted for 40% of IBM's revenue over the past 12 months, rose 16% annually last quarter. But that growth didn't bring Big Blue's sales growth back into positive territory, and its overall revenue fell 0.4%. Analysts expect IBM's revenue and earnings to respectively decline 2% and  10% this year. Therefore, I'd avoid IBM until it can prove that its strategic imperatives growth can offset its top line declines in other businesses. Although I believe that Palo Alto and IBM aren't compelling buys today, investors should still keep an eye out for signs of improvement. For Palo Alto, this means that GAAP losses must narrow alongside non-GAAP income growth. It also must prove, through acquisitions or new services, that its \"best in breed\" reputation in next-gen firewalls can withstand fierce competition . Meanwhile, IBM must prove that its inorganic growth strategy is actually fueling the growth of its strategic imperatives businesses. If IBM gets too aggressive with its purchases, it could \"deworsify\" those businesses instead of streamlining them for stronger growth. It also must introduce meaningful ways to counter cloud infrastructure leaders that are arguably leaving Big Blue behind in the cloud market. If Palo Alto and IBM can accomplish all those things, I'll reevaluate their stocks as potential buys. Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than IBM Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

Image source: Flickr via Tac6 Media. Post-election, Smith \u0026 Wesson Holding (NASDAQ: SWHC)  and Sturm, Ruger (NYSE: RGR)  have stumbled, but 2016 has been a pretty good year to own gun manufacturers and personal defense stocks. Shares of Olin (NYSE: OLN) , and Taser International (NASDAQ: TASR)  are both up 40% or more year-to-date, benefiting individual investors and the many mutual funds holding shares of weapons manufacturers in their portfolios. While many view these companies as sin stocks, they're commonly found in many mutual funds, meaning you might also own a piece of Olin, Ruger, Smith \u0026 Wesson, or Taser, probably through an IRA, 401(k), or other retirement plan. Depending upon how you feel about gun ownership, that may or may not be a problem, but for those who object to the presence of firearms in the home, they may not have even realize they're holding on to something they abhor. According to data from Morningstar , widely held mutual funds from firms including Vanguard, Dimensional Fund Advisors, American Funds, and Fidelity are among the biggest holders of these weapon-maker stocks, though they don't necessarily own all of them or in substantial quantities. For example, five Vanguard funds are the biggest holders of Smith \u0026 Wesson shares, but they come in second to Artisan Partners in Taser ownership and is third in Olin stock. Yet the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index  is a top-five holder of all four weapons manufacturers, with shares of each representing about 2% of its total holdings. Olin is something of a conglomerate, making chemicals and epoxies, but it also owns the rights to the Winchester rifle brand name (the gun itself is made by Browning) while manufacturing Winchester brand ammunition that is used in both long guns and handguns. Ammunition control is a new avenue for gun-control efforts, particularly where it comes to AR-style modern sporting rifles, which are one of the most popular semiautomatic rifles on the market. An outcry was raised last year when the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives sought to ban so-called \"green tip\" bullets, which is the most popular type of ammo used in such rifles. The waters can also easily become muddied when looking at Taser, which manufactures weapons that primarily sell into the law enforcement market. While it also sells body cameras and evidence-management tools, the occasional misuse and abuse of the devices have raised concerns among many. More people now own guns than they have at any other time in recent history, with the Pew Research Center finding 44% of all U.S. homes having a gun in them. And more people are buying guns, too. The FBI recently released its figures for October, showing that its NICS background investigation system for people wanting to buy firearms climbed to a record 2.3 million for the month. It's the 18th straight month the law enforcement agency has recorded all-time high investigations performed. That demand creates a compelling case for individual investors and mutual funds. Of course, there are dozens of other fund families owning shares in these gun stocks, too. The pervasiveness of these ownership stakes means it's possible you have shares of these companies in your portfolio, which is why it's important to look at a fund's holdings if you have an ideological opposition to owning certain types of companies.

Signs of economic sluggishness led some investors to believe that future interest rate increases might be less likely than they originally thought, and that put a damper on the positive momentum the market had generated in recent days. Some stocks posted substantial declines to hold the market back as well, and H\u0026R Block (NYSE: HRB) , PDL BioPharma (NASDAQ: PDLI) , and Tutor Perini (NYSE: TPC) were among the worst performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: H\u0026R Block. Tax reform scares H\u0026R Block investors H\u0026R Block fell 7%, adding to its declines since last week's presidential election. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed a tax plan that would dramatically simplify return preparation for millions of Americans, and investors fear the resulting simplification would lead many of H\u0026R Block's customers to go back to preparing their own returns. Analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the tax-preparation stock from overweight to equal weight, citing the fact that the planned repeal of the Affordable Care Act would also take away penalties for not having coverage, which involve one of the most confusing aspects of tax preparation. Unless the Trump administration is unexpectedly slow in getting tax reform through Congress, H\u0026R Block could find that the coming tax season is its most favorable for a while. PDL BioPharma taps the capital markets PDL BioPharma plunged 18% in the wake of the company's announcement Tuesday night that it would seek to offer $150 million in five-year convertible senior notes. The financing move came after the holding company for equity interests, products, royalty agreements, and debt financing for the biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device technology industries saw its stock climb following the election, and PDL BioPharma was quick to take advantage of the opportunity to raise capital under more favorable conditions. Investors had the typical negative reaction when faced with potential future dilution, but of more importance is the fact that its formerly reliable stream of dividend income has been suspended at least until PDL BioPharma can determine how to move forward more aggressively in its search for further growth. Tutor Perini gets bad news from analysts Finally, Tutor Perini sank 10%. The construction company suffered another analyst downgrade on Wednesday, marking the second in just two days. Analysts at Iceberg Research said the stock could fall by more than half, citing its possible reduced ability to bid successfully on contracts in a way that will maximize profit going forward. Interestingly, though, today's decline gives back only about half of the gains Tutor Perini has enjoyed in the past week, with investors having previously believed that improved prospects for companies with ties to infrastructure construction activity would benefit from the results of the election. Investors will have to wait until 2017 to see whether Tutor Perini can take advantage of predicted improvements in business conditions to add to its upward move so far this month.

The gradual phasing out of antibiotics, preservatives, and high-fructose corn syrup in its products, the packaging and digitization initiatives designed to contemporize the brand, and the renewed attention to metrics such as speed, quality, and order accuracy -- all such actions are intended to remake the company into an exciting destination on a par with fast-casual restaurants. To the oft-stated dream of becoming a \"modern, progressive burger company,\" Easterbrook has lately added a new goal: to \"reassert McDonald's as the global leader of the IEO [informal eating out] industry.\" Such a vision has its financial counterpart in comparable sales that trend consistently higher, quarter after quarter, based both on pricing power and improving guest counts. For investors, looking across turbulent waters of competition and changing consumer tastes, comps that rise predictably represent the green riverbank on the other side of the river that McDonald's is trying to reach. The only problem with this lovely picture is that guest counts in the U.S. have been declining for years, pressuring the very comps they should support. Internally, at least, executives admit that this is not a problem that can be overlooked . And so far, the materials at hand to construct a bridge to rising comps seem ill-suited for the task. The company has \"all-day breakfast,\" which launched last year's turnaround, though its effect is fading. McDonald's also has use of its \"McPick 2\" value menu, which enjoys higher price points than the company's old dollar-based value offerings. Neither of these should be thought of as a permanent lever for traffic. McPick 2 in particular, while fulfilling a segment of market demand, ultimately won't boost franchisee margins or draw in new customers, and it hinders the company's efforts to burnish its image. In truth, McDonald's may be stuck on the wrong side of the river for a while. It may be years before the company can achieve enough ingredient evolution to convince customers they're getting an equivalent product to, let's say, a Shake Shack (NYSE: SHAK) burger, and to persuade them to happily fork over $6 to $7 for the equivalent McDonald's sandwich. McDonald's Sriracha Signature Burger, a precursor to the Sriracha Big Mac that hits test markets in Columbus, Ohio, this week. Image source: McDonald's Corporation. And there's danger in trying too hard to imitate the strategies of smaller competitors such as Shake Shack, specifically their supple use of limited-time offers (LTOs). It's probably tempting, but so far McDonald's has avoided pushing out successive waves of higher-priced, premium LTOs to compete with fast-casual chains, as customer perception hasn't yet caught up to company ambition. Instead, the organization's current approach to menu innovation, while not optimal, entails less risk. McDonald's appears to be trying to raise guest counts by dressing up core items on a limited-time basis. It's a practice that Restaurant Brands International 's(NYSE: QSR) Burger King excels at. Witness the bizarre merger of Burger King's core-menu Whopper sandwich with a burrito this past summer, the \"Whopperito.\" Perhaps not as daringly, this week McDonald's announced the testing of the \"Sriracha Big Mac\" LTO, which comes on the heels of two Big Mac LTOs set to run nationally next year, the Grand Mac and The Mac Jr. This bridging strategy toward higher guest counts is at least consistent with the company's focus on raising core item sales -- a prime component of its original turnaround plan. For some time to come, McDonald's will have to work within a tight set of constraints, and not just the ones I've mentioned. As I've written on several occasions, McDonald's appears to have chosen to purposefully take on debt to return massive amounts of money to shareholders. It's finally on pace to complete its three-year, $30 billion shareholder return program by the end of 2016. Adding debt and sending the check directly to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases prevents an activist shareholder from swooping in and using balance-sheet resources to restructure the company. But as a result, there's barely any credible leverage left, as McDonald's sits with a credit rating just above junk status. Earlier this month, it received another downgrade on its long-term debt from Fitch Ratings, to \"BBB,\" which is considered investment grade, but by the slightest of margins. In essence, McDonald's doesn't have huge amounts of capital left to partner up with franchisees on a multi-year store upgrade, or entertain acquisitions as it has in the past. Menu innovation remains the single item that could most help the company construct its bridge to higher traffic and rising comps. And it's a relatively cheap way to drive sales. At some point, the company will have to introduce new, successful core items that insert a truth beneath all the rebranding efforts. Until then, McDonald's may remain stuck on the wrong side of the river.

Flat industrial production and prices at the producer level threw cold water on investor expectations for stronger economic growth, and a decline in mortgage applications reflected the recent jump in interest rates. Yet some stocks still managed to post solid gains, and Fossil Group (NASDAQ: FOSL) , Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) , and Danaos (NYSE: DAC) were among the best performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well. Image source: Fossil Group. Fossil gets an upgrade Fossil Group climbed 8% after receiving an upgrade from analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets. The analyst company hinged its positive call on the watchmaker on Fossil's initiatives to continue building up its presence in the market for wearable devices. The upgrade, which took Fossil from underweight to overweight, asserts that Fossil is ready to turn around what has been a long period of falling earnings, and early reports suggest that some of its higher-end wearable devices are satisfying shoppers. Given how much the stock has suffered, many believe that Fossil has great turnaround potential if it can find a way to tap into its brand value more effectively. Wearables might be exactly that opportunity going forward. AMD climbs into the cloud Advanced Micro Devices was up 10% in the wake of news that a key server graphics processing unit would become part of the cloud platform that Google offers to its customers. AMD has had recent success in the gaming console space, but its ability to break into the cloud computing market has been more limited, and AMD's primary rival has been far more successful in working its way into data centers for cloud computing applications in the past. With the move, however, AMD will start seeing its FirePro S9300 x2 server GPU show up in certain Google services, and investors hope that the exposure will be a game-changer for Advanced Micro in its competitive efforts against its closest GPU rivals. Investors will want to keep a close eye on AMD to see if the reality of this move lives up to the hype that today's stock-price advance suggests. Danaos rides the shipping wave higher Finally, Danaos gained 9%. The shipping company was just one of many companies in the industry that posted sharp advances, with DryShips in particular having halted trading of its stock in light of massive increases in its share price. In the wake of competitor Hanjin Shipping 's bankruptcy, Danaos and its peers faced investor concerns about overcapacity in the market. Yet an increase in the Baltic Dry Index has raised prospects for dry-bulk shipping companies, and for whatever reason, some investors seem to believe that after such a long period of rock-bottom shipping rates, a recovery could help lift the entire industry higher -- even for container-focused ships like the ones that Danaos specializes in operating. That remains to be seen, but for now, the sector is locked in a frenzied run-up that could eventually crash back down to earth as fast as it gained. Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Fossil Donald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

Is a crash imminent? Image source: Getty Images. Wednesday was a great day to be a dry bulk shipper -- or own a dry bulk shipping stock, or almost any shipping stock, as it turned out. But already, things are starting to turn dicey. As you probably recall, shipping concerns Globus Maritime Ltd. (NASDAQ: GLBS) and Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHIP) both scored big gains earlier today. Both largely held on to their gains at day's end, with Globus closing up 188%, and Seanergy 50%. At the same time, bulk carrying stalwarts such as Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation (NYSE: NNA) , Star Bulk Carriers (NASDAQ: SBLK) , and Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX) joined in the fun. At one point, Navios had risen as high as 15%, Star Bulk came close to hitting 12%, and Diana nearly 21%. Later in the day, however, those gains began petering out. Among this second group, only Navios ended the day with more than a 10% gain (10.4%, to be precise). Meanwhile, Star Bulk saw its gain cut in half, to just 6% -- and Diana Shipping actually booked a loss, down 2.7% at day's end! Diana's decline Wednesday may be instructive. The shipping stock rally that began with a turnaround in pricing on the Baltic Dry Index just ahead of the presidential election and gathered steam after Donald Trump won the White House, may be hitting the shoals at last. Crucially, the one dry bulk shipping stock that we haven't mentioned yet -- but must -- is one that sat out the action entirely on Wednesday. Since the election of Donald Trump, shares of DryShips (NASDAQ: DRYS) had surged an incredible 1,500%  through close of trading Tuesday. Then, on Wednesday, the Nasdaq called a time out and suspended trading in DryShips stock. Nasdaq has asked DryShips to provide insight into why its stock has enjoyed such remarkable gains in such a short period. DryShips apparently failed to respond to the Nasdaq's inquiry by day's end, however, as its shares never resumed trading. What's more, the exchange says officially sanctioned trading in DryShips shares will remain suspended until DryShips \"has fully satisfied Nasdaq's request.\" That's not preventing investors from day-trading DryShips after hours , however. Indeed, according to Yahoo! Finance data, there was a brief frenzy of trading activity in DryShips stock immediately after close of market, with the shares attempting to rise 64% in seven minutes. On one hand, that probably sounds optimistic for whenever DryShips shares receive permission to begin trading freely again. On the other hand, it confirms that the craziness that began last week continues to infect these stocks. When trading ultimately does resume, it could just as easily end in tears, as in cheers.

SodaStream recently reported impressive results for the third quarter of 2016, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. The company's adjusted earnings crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 187.5% and total revenue by 5.5%. Moreover, the company's bottom line increased a robust 213.6% on a year-over-year basis. Sales rose 12.9% year over year on higher demand for sparkling water makers and consumables mainly in Germany, Japan, Australia, the Nordics, the U.S. and Canada. The top-line increase was supported by repositioning of the SodaStream brand around sparkling water coupled with effective marketing programs aimed at increasing household penetration. SODASTREAM INTL Price and Consensus SODASTREAM INTL Price and Consensus | SODASTREAM INTL Quote SodaStream's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also soared 140.6%. Operating income was up 243% year over year, driven by higher operating leverage and gross margin improvement. Owing to the changing consumer preferences toward more healthy food items, the soda industry has suffered a great deal. Carbonated soft drinks industry behemoths like The Coca-Cola Company KO and PepsiCo Inc. PEP have been dealt a heavy blow as well. After reporting weak sales for quite some time now due to low demand for its products, the company posted strong sales and margins in the first nine months of 2016. SodaStream has re-marketed its soda machines as makers of gourmet sparkling water drinks. The company has also adopted a new motto: \"Love Your Water.\" SodaStream has ramped up its marketing drive and has also occupied a place on the shelves of popular U.S. supermarket chain Whole Foods Market, Inc. WFM . We believe these initiatives are paying off. During the third quarter, the company's home carbonation system was used to produce more sparkling water than any other brand worldwide, which resulted in a quarterly record of 7.7 million gas refills.

The project website uses Google Earth's high-resolution aerial images to calculate any roof's solar energy potential.For homeowners, figuring out whether installing thousands of dollars worth of solar panels is a sound investment can be confusing.Project Sunroof aims to make the decision easier - and speed up the adoption of solar energy, which today accounts for less than 1 percent of U.S. electricity generation.Homeowners interested in assessing their property's solar potential can enter their address on Project Sunroof's website, and in roughly a second get a calculation of how many hours of usable sunlight their roof receives, Conkling said.Thousands of lines of computer code analyze factors such as the shade trees cast on a roof, its orientation and local weather patterns, he said.Project Sunroof then connects users whose roof is suitable for solar panels with companies that install them.\"People can come in and very quickly and very easily get a pretty sophisticated understanding of their solar potential and whether it makes sense for them to go solar,\" said Conkling, a product manager for Project Sunroof.The response has been encouraging, he said.In September, Project Sunroof was among 13 projects from around the world to win a Momentum for Change award, which recognises innovative and potentially transformative ways to tackle climate change and move toward a low-carbon future.\"We were impressed by the scalability of the technology with more and more states and homes able to utilize it,\" said Nick Nuttall, a spokesman for the Bonn-based U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, which presents the award.Since launching last year, Project Sunroof has expanded from offering analysis of rooftops in two states to 42 states, from New York to California. Thousands of users have been connected with solar-panel installers, Conkling told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.In many states, homeowners who produce solar energy can sell all or part of it the power grid. Such payments - and other incentives - are often essential to help offset the steep upfront investment, which can run between $17,000 and $24,000 for a typical solar panel system, according to data from research firm GTM Research.Other U.S. companies also map the solar potential of roofs, including Geostellar and Mapdwell. But Conkling said he is confident that Google Earth's global reach and high definition images can help it cover more ground and provide estimates with an unprecedented degree of accuracy.Nuttall, of the U.N. climate secretariat, agrees the system potentially could be used in many more places.\"There seems no reason why one day it could not go global,\" he said.In recent years, Google has invested nearly $2.5 billion in clean energy wind and solar projects, according to the company's corporate website.","description":"'Google Earth sheds light on solar rooftop' on Yahoo7 Finance Australia.

A cheap device is fine for getting TV shows and movies from most popular services onto a big-screen TV — as long as it's a regular, high-definition set. Of course, it's possible to simply watch video on a phone or tablet, but it's not as satisfying from a living-room couch.\n\nHere's a holiday buying guide for the TV-streamers in your life.\n\n___\n\nSTREAMING BUILT-IN\n\nSmart TVs, game consoles and the TiVo digital video recorder all have streaming apps, and if all you watch is Netflix and Hulu, you'll be fine with those. But apps for individual channels such as The CW and FX won't work with every device.\n\nThe exceptions are TVs running Roku software or that have Google's Chromecast technology built in; they tend to have wider app selections.\n\n___\n\nGETTING AROUND\n\nDevices vary in how easy it is to access apps and video. While many devices are getting voice features that let you search multiple services at once, you'll still need to navigate on-screen menus with a remote.\n\nThe exception is Chromecast, which has no menu or remote at all. Instead, you start video on an iPhone or Android phone and send it to the big screen with a tap of a cast button. With some video services, the phone is freed up for other things, though you'll need to use the phone as a remote for pausing and rewinding.\n\nDevices running Google's Android TV come with Chromecast features and pack their menus with video from Google's YouTube service. Amazon's Fire TV device has traditionally favored Amazon video over others, though that's changing as Netflix, HBO and other leading services get prominence on the home screen. Roku is the most service-agnostic of the bunch. Apple TV ships with Apple services, but it's easy to replace those with your favorites.\n\n___\n\nAPP SELECTION\n\nRoku has one of the most complete app libraries, though Apple's iTunes service is notably missing. You'll need an Apple TV to access iTunes.\n\nApple TV also has a good app selection, though out of 25 leading services The Associated Press checked, it's missing direct access to Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and PlayStation Vue. You can get the first three indirectly with a Chromecast-like feature called AirPlay if you have a companion iPhone or other Apple device.\n\nAmazon's Fire TV device is missing iTunes, Google Play, Vudu, ABC, Freeform and the NFL (though some games are shown through Twitter's app).\n\nThe selection on Android TV is also limited, but you can supplement that with apps for Chromecast. With an Android phone, you can get all but iTunes, though getting Amazon video is tough, as it requires getting Amazon's \"Underground\" app store first. With an iPhone, you're missing iTunes, Amazon and USA Network, even with AirPlay. If you just have a Chromecast device with an iPhone, you're also missing Freeform (formerly ABC Family) and CNN.\n\nYou'll still need individual subscriptions to these services. The streaming device merely enables playback on the big screen.\n\n___\n\nENTRY-LEVEL DEVICES\n\nAmazon's Fire TV Stick stands out as a speedy, capable device for $40. It now comes with a voice remote for searches and Alexa assistant queries on weather, sports scores and other information.\n\nThe Roku Express is cheaper at $30, though there's no voice remote, and the interface is slower (which doesn't matter as much once you sit back and watch the video). It's a great choice considering its wider app selection, notwithstanding the lack of iTunes.\n\nGoogle's entry-level Chromecast costs $35 — affordable, though the gadget is clunky without its own remote. It's slightly better with Android than iPhones.\n\n___\n\nMID-RANGE DEVICES\n\nXiaomi's Mi Box is a speedy Android TV device with a nice price tag, $69. It supports higher-resolution video known as 4K, an option that once required more expensive devices. But you need a 4K TV and services that offer 4K video — so far, Netflix and YouTube do so for just some of their offerings. Mi Box also supports HDR picture quality. HDR, or high dynamic range, promises brighter whites, darker blacks and a richer range of colors — but you need an HDR TV and HDR video.\n\nGoogle's new Chromecast Ultra also has 4K and HDR support for $69. Because Mi Box also does Chromecast, you get more overall for the same price. Mi Box also has a voice remote.\n\nThe Roku Premiere also offers 4K for $80, but its remote lacks voice support. Amazon's regular Fire TV has 4K and a voice remote for $90. Neither has HDR. For now, HDR sets are rarer than 4K, and even 4K sets aren't that common.\n\n___\n\nWHY PAY MORE?\n\nThe $100 Roku Premiere Plus and the $130 Roku Ultra offer both 4K and HDR. The remote for both also has a headphone jack for listening when everyone else is asleep. The Ultra also has a voice remote, something many cheaper devices offer. That remote also has gaming buttons and emits a sound when you lose it in a couch.\n\nFor hard-core gamers, consider the $200 Nvidia Shield TV, an Android TV with both 4K and HDR support, plus faster processors for games with intensive graphics.\n\nAnother premium choice is Apple TV, which starts at $149. You don't get 4K or HDR, which won't matter for regular sets. Instead, you get plenty of apps that do more than play video. You can browse Ikea's catalog, order food from Grubhub and get the AccuWeather forecasts. For video, an upcoming app simply called TV promises to bring together all your viewing from various channels and services. An iPhone isn't required, but helps. Sorry, no Android.\n\nAnd for iTunes, Apple TV is the only choice.\n\n___\n\nThis story makes a correction in the name of the $100 Roku product.","description":"From Yahoo Singapore Finance: Your streaming TV options have gotten better and cheaper.

All four FANGs had been trading at or near all-time highs, but mixed earnings for Apple, Amazon and Alphabet weighed on the group.\n\nBut after the election, a sector rotation ensued, with industries such as drugs and banks getting a lift from Trump's win, and techs, alternative-energy and other arenas getting hit.\n\nIBD'S TAKE: The biggest tech companies, of course, aren't necessarily the best tech stocks for investors at any given time. Which techs are best? There are tons of opinions and answers when asking that question, but a good source to put on your checklist is IBD's Tech Leaders.\n\nBut Trump's election-campaign views and expected priorities have good as well as bad connotations for tech industries.\n\nWilliam Blair analyst Bhavan Suri summed it up in a research note Wednesday:\n\n\"Overall, we believe his views on global trade, net neutrality and internet privacy, and immigration could have negative consequences for technology companies, but his tax plan (including reducing the repatriation tax rate to 10%) would be a net positive given the large amount of foreign cash that many technology companies possess.\"\n\nTrump's repatriation tax plan could bring big bucks back to the U.S. for the top five companies with overseas holdings. Besides Apple and Alphabet, the top five include Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nIn his note, Suri was not shy about pointing out what Microsoft, Cisco and Oracle might target with that cash. Microsoft, he said, might go after ServiceNow (NOW), Twilio (TWLO) or Symantec (SYMC). Cisco he sees eyeing FireEye (FEYE), Gigamon (GIMO) and F5 Networks (FFIV). Oracle, he says, might take a run at Veeva Systems (VEEV) or Tableau Software (DATA).\n\nIn the meantime, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon and Netflix rose for a second straight day. Facebook was the only decliner, falling 0.73% to 116.34, after touching a more than four-month low of 113.55 on Monday.\n\nApple was the big gainer of the bunch on Wednesday, rising 2.7% to 110.04. That was easily its best day since Trump's win, marking its biggest percentage gain since Sept. 14. It is nearing a 118.79 buy point out of a flat base.\n\nNetflix stock rose a fraction to 115.17. It's forming a cup-with-handle base, with a buy point of 129.40.\n\nShares of Alphabet and Amazon rose 0.62% and 0.39%, respectively.\n\nRELATED:\n\nApple, FANGs Stop The Bleeding Post-Trump","description":"Apple stock jumped for a second straight day, and all but Facebook among the FANG stocks rose for a second day, following big declines after the Trump win.","keywords":"","time":1479333933,"url":"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/investors/rss/SIG=132o5mivf/*http://www.investors.com/news/technology/apple-and-the-fang-stocks-day-6-after-trump-and-up-day/"},{"title":"AMD Breaks Out On Google Deal; 4 Chip Stocks In Or Near Buy Range","body":"SIGN OUT\n\nEdit\n\nSIGN IN\n\nREGISTER\n\nKeep me signed in\n\nCan't access my account\n\nNeed to register?\n\nI am a current subscriber and need to register.\n\nI am not a current subscriber and want to register for a free membership.\n\nNot a member?

Meanwhile, Texas Instruments (TXN) and Applied Materials (AMAT) are setting up in bases.\n\nAMD\n\nAMD rose 10% to 7.67, just closing above a 7.63 entry area. AMD, which was added to IBD's Swing Trader on Wednesday, hit a 4-1/2-year high of 8 on Aug. 19.\n\nAMD leapt Wednesday on news that Google will use its FirePro server GPUs for its cloud-computing platform starting next year. AMD is trying to gain ground in that market as Nvidia (NVDA) already serves Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, Microsoft (MSFT) cloud offering Azure and others. AMD and Nvidia are longtime rivals in graphics chips, which have turned out to have uses in many new fields such as cloud computing, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia shares rose 6.3% to 91.63, another all-time high. The stock is up 35% since Nov. 10, when Nvidia announced blowout earnings. Nvidia is greatly extended from any proper buy point.\n\nKLA-Tencor\n\nKLA-Tencor fell 5 cents to 77.70 on Wednesday. On Tuesday, shares rose 3% to 77.75, moving above a 75.60 buy point. KLA-Tencor shares tumbled three months ago on reports that a planned merger deal with Lam Research (LRCX) would fail due to regulatory objections. But when the chip gear makers decided not to get hitched in early October, both stocks rallied.\n\nTexas Instruments\n\nTexas Instruments rose 0.2% to 71.20. TI has a buy point of 72.68 in a flat base going back to late July. TI gapped up to a longtime high on July 26 following strong quarterly results.\n\nApplied Materials\n\nApplied Materials climbed 1.4% to 30.02, a day after rising back above its 50-day line. The stock is approaching a 31.17 buy point. The chip gear giant reports quarterly earnings after Thursday's market close. EPS is expected to rise 124%, with sales expanding at the fastest pace in almost six years.\n\nRELATED:\n\nApplied Materials, Wal-Mart, Best Buy Form Bases: Investing Action Plan","description":"AMD shot up 10% on the stock market today following news that Alphabet-unit Google will use its chips in its cloud platform.

For Q3, Amazon reported Amazon Web Services revenue rose 55% to $3.23 billion.\n\nIBD'S Take: Amazon stock has moved up the last two trading days, bouncing off a five-month low of 710.10 on Nov. 14, but is trading below its 50-day moving average. The stock sports an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it has outperformed 56% of all stocks in the past year. To find out more about the stock, IBD Stock Checkup is the place to go.\n\n\"We remain impressed with the pace of innovation at AWS,\" Bracelin wrote. \"It is contributing to much higher profit levels than most investors anticipated, particularly for a business that is approaching a $13 billion run-rate yet is still growing by 55% year over year.\"\n\nAmazon stock rose 0.4% to 746.49 in the stock market today.\n\nBracelin estimates capital expenditures among the top seven cloud providers will reach $45 billion in 2016, up 24%.\n\n\"This large amount of spending creates an increasingly big hurdle rate for new entrants given the large head start of the existing suppliers and massive amount of capital required to establish a global data center footprint that is comparable in size and reach,\" he wrote.\n\nMicrosoft Azure just passed the $2 billion milestone for revenue, Bracelin wrote, making it still just one-fifth the size of AWS.\n\n\"Bottom line: AWS has a material first-mover advantage over peers, particularly given its internal culture drives a rapid pace of innovation,\" he said.\n\nThe Pacific Crest report comes just ahead of AWS re:Invent, Amazon's annual cloud computing user conference Nov. 28 in Las Vegas. It's expected to attract 24,000 attendees.

There are better stocks for investors to consider now. Check out the IBD feature Stocks Near A Buy Zone.\n\nAlmost one-third of iPhone buyers purchased the premium iPhone 7 Plus model in the first month of availability, CIRP said. That's nearly the same proportion as in 2015, and higher than the one-quarter of buyers who chose the new Plus model in 2014, Lowitz said.\n\nThe dual-camera iPhone 7 Plus has been in tight supply since the handset launched on Sept. 16. The dual-camera system is capable of taking digital SLR-quality photos.\n\nApple attracted fewer switchers from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android operating system with this year's new iPhones, CIRP said. Android phone users accounted for 17% of iPhone buyers during the iPhone 7 launch period. That compares with 26% for last year's iPhone 6S series launch. But it's higher than the 12% of iPhone buyers who switched from Android during the iPhone 6 series launch, CIRP said.\n\nThe reason Android switchers were higher last year is likely because iPhone owners sat out the iPhone 6S upgrade cycle, CIRP partner and co-founder Mike Levin said in a statement.\n\nCIRP based its findings on surveys of 300 U.S. Apple customers during the month after the new iPhone releases.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHedge Fund Greenlight Capital Cuts Stake In Apple Again\n\nApple Might Add 'Jet White' iPhone 7 To Lineup: Report","description":"Apple's iPhone 7 series smartphones accounted for 73% of U.S. iPhone sales during their first month of release, which is higher than last year's iPhone 6S.","keywords":"apple,iphone,smartphones,google,android,alphabet","time":1479331758,"url":"http://us.rd.yahoo.com/finance/external/investors/rss/SIG=135p7blep/*http://www.investors.com/news/technology/click/apple-iphone-7-plus-big-seller-despite-tight-supply/"},{"title":"How I became a cyborg and joined an underground medical movement","body":"A man with metal horns protruding from his forehead and a split tongue poking out between his teeth advanced toward me with a scalpel. “I’ve never done this before,” he joked, inching closer. A full-sleeve tattoo snaked out from beneath his black T-shirt, extending from a demon on his bicep to a skull on his fist. My eyes darted between skull and scalpel, then instinctively shut as I cringed, bracing for contact. Zack Watson, the inked-up body modification artist I’d hired — and drove seven hours from New York City to see — was about to sew a magnet under my skin. The entire procedure took two minutes: Watson rubbed iodine on my right ring finger for sanitization, sliced open the soft pad of my fingertip, spread the edges of my skin apart with a curved hook and inserted a gold-plated, silicone-coated magnet the size of a pencil eraser inside with tweezers. He then wiped up the blood with gauze, tied my finger shut with two stitches, and told me how to take care of the wound in the weeks following to make sure my body didn’t reject the magnet as it healed.\n\nZack Watson sews a magnet into Jennifer Booton’s finger\n\nWatson, who has several implants of his own, including silicone rectangles in his forearms that make his skin feel riblike, has been putting magnets and chips in people for three years at Ice 9 Studio, a tattoo and piercing parlor in Pittsburgh’s South Side Flats (though he recently left to open his own shop). His efforts are part of an underground movement in which people get implants as commonly as others get tattoos. Interest has been spreading, with Watson quickly working through his latest supply of magnets. One woman recently traveled to Ice 9 Studio from Australia for a radio-frequency identification chip she uses to store personal information. Watson’s business frequently comes through his connection to Grindhouse Wetware, a Pittsburgh-area startup of “biohackers” who aim to augment the human body with technology. If successful, they’ll be at the vanguard of a movement called transhumanism that experiments with how technology can give us new, almost-superhuman, abilities.\n\nIs biohacking the next phase of human evolution?(3:03)\n\nAn underground community is experimenting with tech implants that could disrupt the healthcare industry by pushing the limits of the human body. But will regulation stop their devices from wide adoption?\n\nBiohacking enthusiasts have tinkered with electronic tattoos and subdermal — underneath-the-skin — implants for two decades, sharing their efforts in videos on YouTube and internet forums to spread and encourage innovation. Proponents believe smart implants represent the future of wearable technology, potentially making humans healthier and more efficient while providing new opportunity to consumer-technology companies such as Apple Inc.\n\nAAPL, +2.69%\n\nand Alphabet Inc.\n\nGOOGL, +0.62%\n\nGOOG, +0.79%\n\nthat are investing heavily in technology that could revolutionize health care. “You’re talking about extending your body to its maximum potential — and then beyond,” said Grindhouse co-founder Tim Cannon.\n\nWatson and his 6-month-old son, Thor, in Pittsburgh\n\nIn the late 1990s, an Englishman named Kevin Warwick was among the first people to put an RFID chip under his skin, letting him turn lights on and off and interact with appliances by scanning the chip with computer-controlled devices. Today, many people — including Warwick — are pushing that concept even further. Amal Graafstra, who has tinkered with biohacking for at least a decade, is developing a smart gun that would use an RFID chip to ensure that it only fires in the hands of its owner. French tattoo artist JC Sheitan Tenet, who lost his right arm as a child and had to relearn how to draw with his non-dominant left hand, was recently fitted with a working tattoo machine prosthetic so he could resume work with his dominant hand.\n\nFrench tattoo artist JC Sheitan Tenet shows off his working tattoo machine prosthetic arm.\n\nNeil Harbisson, who is colorblind, has an antenna in his skull that lets him “hear” color through audible vibrations. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology in partnership with a research arm of Microsoft Corp.\n\nMSFT, +1.32%\n\nrecently developed a device called DuoSkin that looks like a metallic tattoo and duals as a trackpad for mobile devices. And Warwick is developing brain implants that can help predict and even alleviate tremors associated with Parkinson's disease. Cyborg culture still flies largely under the radar, but investors and corporations have begun to take notice, funding and building products inspired by many of the same ideas. Much of the mainstream investment so far has focused on tracking and improving health.\n\nGoogle, for example, is working on a glucose-monitoring contact lens. MC10 recently released a smart Band-Aid-like adhesive called BioStamp Research Connect that helps researchers monitor heart rates and movement. Biotricity is developing a wearable called Biolife that can monitor heart rhythm, respiration, calories, temperature and physical activity while attached to a shirt or sports bra. Grindhouse, meanwhile, is building an implantable device it calls Circadia, which records health data and transmits it via Bluetooth to Android devices. Grindhouse argues subdermal devices can collect more accurate data than devices that only sit atop the body, such as Apple Watch and Fitbit. It also believes that software currently being developed by other companies, such as Cisco System Inc.\n\nCSCO, -0.41%\n\nwill make it easier to sift through and make sense of that data, helping doctors spot long-term health trends and perhaps one day even predict disease before symptoms appear. All of these predictions come as global adoption of wearables is forecast to boom. Juniper Research, which tracks consumer technology trends, expects world-wide wearable shipments to reach 420 million by 2020, more than four times the 80 million shipped in 2015. A similar surge is predicted for medical devices, with shipments projected to triple to 70 million over the next four years.\n\nBy 2020, a third of health/life sciences and consumer product companies will begin to develop the first wave of products that integrate the human body with technology, according to recent predictions published by IDC, which tracks the consumer tech industry. IDC is referring to this industry as “augmented humanity,” and predicts the concept will go mainstream by the middle of next decade. “The next four years are the ‘proto’ period where we’ll see proof of concept/prototype offerings,” said IDC chief analyst Frank Gens. “And the first Amazons, Googles, and Facebooks of the next era are likely to emerge.” The increased interest is making it easier for companies to connect with potential investors. Grindhouse says it has been approached by several venture capitalists and physicians who have expressed interest in its work, though it declined to name them. Y Combinator, a Mountain View, Calif.-based accelerator of early stage startups, recently added human augmentation to its top-ten list of favored startup types it is seeking for investment opportunities. Many of the more established companies MarketWatch reached out to for this story — including Apple, Fitbit\n\nFIT, -1.05%\n\nand Google — declined to comment, citing policies not to discuss future products or strategy. But many of their recent investments and products have illustrated interest in health technology and human augmentation. In March, Apple launched CareKit, a platform that hosts apps designed to analyze health data produced by its smartwatch. The iOS app One Drop tracks glucose levels, food intake, medicine consumption and activity for patients with diabetes. Alphabet, meanwhile, went through a massive organizational restructuring in 2015 so it could invest more freely in experimental endeavors, including those in life sciences, such as its smart contact lenses.\n\nCisco was one of the only legacy companies that agreed to comment on this story, telling MarketWatch about an industrial-grade software platform it’s developing that would tie a broad spectrum of health data, including data from wearables, together for doctors in the cloud. “Any data generated from those devices…and anything [a user does] across the continuum of care, will be sourced and put in the platform,” said Barbara Casey, who leads enterprise health care initiatives at Cisco. It will give doctors a “much more complete picture” of a patient, she said. To be sure, experts see speed bumps along the way. Companies “can see the potential profit,” said Warwick, whose experiments are funded by grants provided through Reading University, but there’s still consumer resistance to more invasive health technology, and companies may want to see more social acceptance before committing further. Juniper, which helped coin the term “invisibles” in reference to dermal and subdermal wearables, expects the market to remain “embryonic” for a while, partly because most people haven’t thought twice about putting technology in their bodies.\n\nAmal Graafstra's implanted RFID chips, seen on a 2006 on a 2006 X-ray.\n\nSome of that may be due to dissatisfaction with current options. In 2014, Endeavour Partners estimated that activity trackers get abandoned after an average of six months. Users may be expressing fatigue with the overabundance of data produced by such devices without enough context telling them what it all means to their long-term health, said Juniper analyst James Moar. Others believe medical-grade or invasive devices might end up being too expensive for many consumers, though that might be addressed if doctors write prescriptions for FDA-approved tech implants the way they might for, say, reading glasses. For the vast majority of people, though, current wrist-bound devices like Apple Watch, while they may be imperfect, are likely accurate enough, said Kate McCarthy, a Forrester Research health care IT analyst. Also Read: Brain implants would make ‘The Matrix’ come to life “It’s OK that there’s a degree of inaccuracy,” said McCarthy, who uses Apple Watch to manage her symptoms from Addison’s disease, a degenerative disorder that occurs when the body fails to produce sufficient levels of the hormone cortisol. “It’s close enough for me to do the things I need to do.” There are also regulatory concerns. In July, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it won’t scrutinize “low risk,” outside-the-body, health wearables that don’t purport to produce professional-grade medical data. But implants that claim such accuracy would likely face rigorous approval processes. Invasive products — those that “penetrate or pierce the skin or mucous membranes of the body,” according to the FDA — and those that claim to help treat a specific medical condition, could take months or even years to reach consumers. Still, advocates for the biohacking and transhumanism movements say consumers and Fortune 500 companies are warming to the potential of next-generation, health-monitoring devices. Ryan O’Shea, Grindhouse’s head of media, believes demand will increase as devices get more advanced and personal and the mechanisms to understand health data are improved.\n\n“When you have a device that’s going to be able to get accurate blood oxygen levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and then kick it out to your devices — perhaps even alert a doctor — people are really going to see the benefit,” he said. “It could save a life.” Also See: Biohackers implant computers, earbuds and antenna in their bodies That would mean an end to “measuring your activity for activity’s sake” like people do now with Fitbits, said MC10 co-founder Rooz Ghaffari. Increasingly, data will be gathered with purpose, which will help doctors provide better preventive care and help people manage their disabilities, he said. Warwick and O’Shea both believe technological advances will give humanity an evolutionary boost similar to that provided by eyeglasses, pacemakers, prosthetic limbs and medicine. Warwick, for example, is studying how ultrasound might be used to help blind people navigate their surroundings. “We’ve been directing human evolution since we invented fire,” said O’Shea. “The whole medical industry is a biohacking industry. We just don’t call it that.” After Zack Watson finished implanting my magnet, I tested his work by lifting a needle with my finger’s magnetic pull. It dangled there, and I laughed, amused that I could now do magic tricks and freak people out at bars. Later, in a dingy unfinished basement in the unassuming home Cannon rents 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh that serves as Grindhouse’s lab, Cannon sent Morse code messages to my magnet using a device called Bottlenose his company developed that emits vibrations through electromagnetic fields. The magnet’s purpose, I quickly realized, was not to pick up small metal objects and amaze my friends -- though I still do that -- but to sense things others can’t.\n\nJennifer Booton feels magnetic pulses in her finger in Grindhouse’s basement labs.\n\nSteve Haworth, a pioneer of subdermal implants who sells the specially coated magnets to body artists and does his own body modification work in Phoenix, says the magnetic implant grants its users a sixth sense, allowing them to detect waves emitted by motors and electrical equipment that are invisible to others. My finger often tingles near microwaves, laptops and smartphones. Also Watch: Bodyhackers implant RFID chips to customize themselves My implant officially makes me part of the cyborg culture, Cannon assured me. He encouraged me to participate in web forums and Facebook groups and share my healing progress and experiences, saying that exchange of data is crucial to the movement’s advancement.\n\nI sat with Cannon as his team gathered in his basement and a few others from around the world tuned in via Google Hangouts for their weekly meeting. They were dissecting the various components of their ambitious biotech projects when we launched into a discussion about the far-off future of wearable technologies. They told me how they imagine a world in which implants are so in tune with our bodies they’ll engage a home’s heater before a user even realizes they’re cold. Screens, they imagine, might just be projections of our own imagination, placed in our line of vision by chips in our eyes. These aren’t just lunatic predictions from a group of science fiction fans: Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster recently predicted something similar, saying in a note to clients this summer that he believes some sort of wearable — likely glasses or contact lenses — will “replace the majority of screens in our everyday lives” within 10 years. “There’s a lot of money to be made just around the corner,” said Marlo Webber, a Grindhouse engineer who moved from Australia to Pittsburgh earlier this year to be closer to the action. “The possibilities,” Cannon said, “are endless.”","description":"MarketWatch sent me to Pittsburgh to become a cyborg.

News that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google plans to add AMD's Radeon-based FirePro server GPUs to its cloud platform in 2017 seems to be the main driver. The stock had settled a bit by 2:45 p.m. EST, up about 9.25%.\n\nSo what\n\nAMD is playing catch-up to rival NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it comes to cloud computing. NVIDIA has been focused on getting its Telsa GPUs into cloud data centers for years, and the company recently announced a blowout third quarter featuring a tripling of its data-center revenue. NVIDIA's GPUs are already available for users of Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and IBM's cloud platform.\n\nBeginning in 2017, AMD's FirePro S9300 x2 server GPUs, the company's most powerful, will be used to accelerate Google Compute Engine and Google Cloud Machine Learning services. Possible use cases include medical and financial simulations, machine learning, and video rendering and transcoding.\n\n\"The adoption of AMD GPU technology in Google Cloud Platform is a validation of the progress AMD has made in GPU hardware and our Radeon Open Compute Platform, which is the only fully open source hyperscale GPU compute platform in the world today,\" Said Raja Koduri, SVP and chief architect, Radeon Technologies Group, AMD. \"We expect that our momentum in GPU computing will continue to accelerate with future hardware and software releases and advances in the ecosystem of middleware and libraries.\"\n\nNow what\n\nIt's important to note that Google will also be adding NVIDIA's Tesla P100 and K80 GPUs to its cloud platform next year, so this isn't bad news for NVIDIA. For AMD, it represents tangible progress in the company's effort to become a major player in the accelerator market. NVIDIA's GPUs remain far more prevalent among cloud-computing providers, but this is a step in the right direction for AMD.\n\nStill, a 10% jump in the stock price seems excessive. No details on the quantity of GPUs were given, so it's unclear exactly how big of a deal this is. Given Google's choice to add GPUs from both companies, this is as much a win for NVIDIA as it is for AMD.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

The Mountain View, Calif., company also rejected charges that it unfairly promoted its shopping service and blocked rivals in online search advertising.EU regulators are expected to rule next year on those issues, potentially ordering Google to change its business practices and levying huge fines. The case has hung over Google since the European Commission opened its investigation six years ago, following complaints from Microsoft Corp and other rivals.The Android case poses a keen risk to Google as the operating system has yielded about $22 billion in profit for the company since its release in 2008, an Oracle Corp lawyer told a U.S. court in January.Pichai last met with Vestager and Oettinger in February, shortly after he was named chief executive of Google.During a visit to London earlier this week, Pichai announced an expansion of Google's presence in the city, saying he was optimistic about Britain's future as a tech hub, despite the uncertainty caused by the nation's vote to leave the European Union in June.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee and Julia Love; Editing by Marguerita Choy)What to Read Next","description":"The chief executive of Alphabet Inc's  Google and the European Union's antitrust chief will  meet on Friday, following the U.S. technology group's formal  rejection this month of a spate of charges, including blocking  rivals in online search advertising.

For instance, financial stocks like Bank of America Corp.\n\nBAC, -2.03%\n\nand J.P. Morgan Chase \u0026 Co.\n\nJPM, -2.47%\n\nhave been on a tear on hopes of easier financial regulations. Meanwhile, tech stocks including Amazon.com Inc.\n\nAMZN, +0.44%\n\nand Google parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nGOOG, +0.79%\n\nGOOGL, +0.62%\n\nhave been hurting big-time on fears of pain abroad and a rollback of “net neutrality” safeguards among other concerns. Read: Trump-fueled rally in bank stocks has gone too far, analyst says More volatility is assuredly ahead as investors make tactical changes to their stock portfolios in anticipation of 2017. But one of the biggest areas of uncertainty and change right now isn’t in stocks at all — it’s in bonds. And perhaps surprisingly, the environment is looking pretty good for investors looking to buy bonds right now. Here’s what income and bond investors need to know about the next few months: Another interest-rate hike is preordained. According to the CME’s FedWatch forecasting tool, there is a 91% chance of a rate hike in December to a range of 0.50% to 0.75%. That’s not surprising, seeing as the Federal Reserve has talked a big talk about rate increases in calendar 2016, but thus far we haven’t seen a single one. The expectation that the Fed has to eventually follow through on its hawkish talk — coupled with criticism from Republicans about the current rate picture — makes it very difficult to imagine we will see the December meeting come and go without another increase to benchmark rates. December will mark the one-year anniversary of the Federal Reserve’s beginning of “liftoff” in interest rates, and you can bet we will see the sequel to last year’s rate hike in a few weeks. Read: Fed’s Bullard still favoring December rate hike However, that hike has been priced in. Of course, it’s important to note that bond markets have already responded in kind after rates exploded in the past week or so. After trading briefly under 1.8% on Election Day, yields on the 10-year Treasury\n\nTMUBMUSD10Y, -1.11%\n\nhit 2.3% recently — the highest level since January — on expectations of a higher interest-rate environment. So if you’re waiting for the Federal Open Market Committee meeting to make a move, you’ve missed the boat. Case in point: The popular iShares 20+ Year Treasury bond ETF\n\nTLT, +0.90%\n\nhas been pummeled about 6% in the past week as higher rates have weighed on the value of bonds and bond funds. That move is a clear sign that markets have already adjusted in a big way.\n\nIs biohacking the next phase of human evolution?(3:03)\n\nAn underground community is experimenting with tech implants that could disrupt the healthcare industry by pushing the limits of the human body. But will regulation stop their devices from wide adoption?\n\nDon’t expect any more big moves until January. “I do believe this rate rise is about 80% of the way through — at least this leg of it,” legendary bond investor Jeff Gundlach told CNBC on Friday. That sounds about right, particularly as markets wait for the FOMC meeting on Dec. 13-14. After we get the rate hike everyone is expecting, we wait for the holidays and the lame-duck Congress to wrap. In other words, there’s a good two months of nothin’ ahead between now and Inauguration Day. Perhaps there aren’t any big moves in all of 2017. Of course, any big moves the market will make in 2017 must be incumbent on Trump and Republicans in Congress delivering on their big promises to break the U.S. out of its current stagnation. As James Mackintosh wrote rather cuttingly in The Wall Street Journal recently: “It has taken markets just four days to price in four years of President Donald Trump.” So even if some of the bull case lately for stocks eventually come to fruition, how much of a pro-business climate in Washington is already priced in? Keep in mind how ho-hum 2016 was with thin market volume and rates absurdly right back where they started the year despite all the Fed watching. Give me a good reason, then, why it has to be different next year. What’s the conservative bond trade? Given the already stretched valuation for stocks and the big move that just got priced into bonds, perhaps an investment in intermediate bonds isn’t that foolish after all. I personally have used the recent market move as an opportunity to rotate out of some equity positions trading at high levels and move a bit of cash back into bonds at long last, since the interest-rate risk seems reasonably low compared with prior months. A good middle-of-the-road play is the Vanguard Intermediate-Term Bond ETF\n\nBIV, +0.01%\n\nthat charges a rock-bottom 0.09% annually and yields 2.2%. With an average duration of 6.5 years, it doesn’t have long-tail risk regarding future rate hikes. And with about 50% of the fund in government bonds and the rest in investment-grade corporates, it’s focused on high-quality debt. What’s the aggressive trade? If you want to take the tiger by the tail, the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF\n\nJNK, -0.39%\n\nyields about 6.5% after a modest selloff. If you believe Trump and the GOP will lead to less burdensome regulations and thus lower default rates in energy and mining — two sectors that are common playgrounds for junk bond offerings — this fund is worth a look. And keep in mind that while theoretically conservative long-term bond funds like TLT have taken it on the chin, JNK has seen a much more modest decline of less than 2%.","description":"Bond yields have jumped, and investors are nervous.

The block was evidently made at the request of North Korean officials, who “formally demanded” that Chinese citizens “not address leader Kim Jong-un in the future as ‘Kim the Fat,’” Hong Kong’s Apple Daily reports.\n\nIn response to the block, web users have developed inventive new ways to write the nickname without triggering the filter. From Language Lab:Chinese netizens promptly adapted by writing Jīn sān pàng 金三胖 (“Kim Third Fat”) as xīn pàng 鑫胖 (“wealth fat”), where xīn 鑫 is thought of as sān jīn 三金 (“three jin” [i.e., ‘gold / Kim’]’).If necessary to get around the censors, netizens can also divide pàng 胖 (“fat”) into yuè 月 (“moon”) and bàn 半 (“half”), thus jīn sān yuè bàn 金三月半 (“Kim / gold March / three months half”) = Jīn sān pàng 金三胖 (“Kim Third Fat”).In a similar manner, Chinese web users refer to censorship as “river crab,” a homophone for the blocked word “harmonious,” itself a euphemism for the blocked word “censorship.”The Chinese government, however, appeared to be unamused by the ingenuity of its citizens.\n\n“What I want to stress is that China has always dedicated itself to constructing a rational, cultured and healthy environment for public opinion,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, who denied the government banned the word, told reporters. “[China] does not approve of insulting or ridiculing language to address any country’s leader.”","description":"An attempt at silencing critics of North Korea instead showcased the adaptability of written Chinese when internet users in China found a clever workaround for a banned nickname for Kim Jong Un.","keywords":"north korea, china, censorship, kim jong un, Gizmodo","time":1479352270,"url":"http://gizmodo.com/kim-jong-un-gets-new-mean-nickname-after-chinese-censor-1789073146"},{"title":"Fake News Stories 'Outperformed' Real Ones on Facebook in Weeks Before Election","body":"Photo: Getty\n\nAccording to a new Buzzfeed report, the top stories from fake news sources attracted more engagement on Facebook than the top stories from legitimate news organizations in the weeks leading up to the election, generating more shares, comments and reactions on the social network.On the websites it tracked, Buzzfeed found four of the five top performing stories came from fake news sites, with a single article from The Washington Post reaching the level of engagement achieved by stories like “WikiLeaks CONFIRMS Hillary Sold Weapons to ISIS” and “FBI Agent Suspected in Hillary Email Leaks Found Dead in Apparent Murder-Suicide” between August and election day.That analysis appears to contradict comments Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg made in the days after the election. Speaking at the Techonomy business conference on Thursday, Zuckerberg said he doubted fake news stories on Facebook affected the results of the election, as they represent “a very small amount of the content” on the site, a thought he later expanded upon on his own Facebook page.\n\n“Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” wrote Zuckerberg. “Only a very small amount is fake news and hoaxes. The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”Zuckerberg’s claim that hoaxes are not partisan seems equally suspect. According to Buzzfeed’s analysis, 17 of the 20 top-performing fake election stories were “overtly pro-Donald Trump or anti-Hillary Clinton.” And on Monday, Gizmodo reported that Facebook developed a tool to fight fake news stories that ended up disproportionately affecting right-wing news sites (the tool was never deployed).\n\nGizmodo has reached out to Facebook for comment.

Road planning, earthquake management and government-sanctioned mass-scale privacy invasions are just a part of living. So why not just lean into it with your SimCity game? Right??\n\nThe building in question by Snatch16\n\nYesterday, The Intercept published an investigation on 33 Thomas Street, AKA the AT\u0026T Long Lines Building, and concluded that it’s not just 29 floors of shady telecommunications goings-on. “It also appears to be one of the most important National Security Agency surveillance sites on U.S. soil—a covert monitoring hub that is used to tap into phone calls, faxes, and internet data,” reporters Ryan Gallagher and Henrik Moltke wrote in “The NSA’s Spy Hub in New York, Hidden in Plain Sight.”\n\nCode-named TITANPOINTE, which couldn’t be anything other than future fodder for a bad stealth/action game, the skyscraper has apparently targeted the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations and 38 other countries.

The tragedies never seem end. Harambe was shot dead in front of children. David Bowie and Prince died unexpectedly. Oh yeah, and we elected a screaming giant cheese wedge to be the next president. All of this bad news might want to make you just runaway for a while. Now, there’s an easier way to do it.\n\nAvailable in the Steam store today for free, the new version of Google Earth lets anyone wearing the HTC Vive headset walk the streets of the most iconic cities in the world, dive through canyons like a hawk, and float around in space, staring at the pale blue dot from the abyss.The launch of Google Earth VR comes with a bunch of guided tours to make it easier for anyone that doesn’t have great geography skills or simply wants to learn something new about a place they’ve never been to. Sites like the Amazon River, Grand Canyon, and Manhattan skyline are among the few dozen locations that you can choose from. As someone who wrote the Gizmodo HTC Vive review, I had a lot of familiarity with the games and other VR experiences available for the headset, so I decided to try out Google Earth VR. I downloaded the software in about a minute, launched the program, and was greeted with short video. The experience starts with a guided tour of all of the things you can do in Google Earth VR. You’ll see a preview of different cities, mountainous areas, desserts and other cool landscapes. When the video ends after a little more than two minutes, you’re left staring at the Earth from space.\n\nA small annotation on the controller shows you how to zoom in, spin the earth, and pick a location to go to. The controls are actually really simple. When you press the trackpad on the left controller, you zoom in and out. You can zoom in all the way to street level, so you can walk around. When you press the trackpad on the right controller, it tilts the Earth, turning it into a flat surface so that you can walk around. You’re basically transitioning from looking at a globe to looking at a flat Earth similar to the way you would on Google Maps. The transition sequence between a spherical Earth and flat one can be a little startling. It also makes it difficult to explore at times.\n\nIt took me about two minutes to learn the controls. The software projects an image of the Earth in front of you that appears to be roughly the size of a movie theater screen. So if you accidentally zoom in on the wrong area, it can be a pain in the ass to get situated. Just like a lot of other VR experiences, once you get the hang of the controls, it’s smooth sailing.\n\nMy first goal in Google Earth VR was to visit my hometown of Chicago, and once I figured out the controls, I basically just pointed at the Great Lakes on the globe and kept zooming in until I could see Willis Tower in all of its glory. I flew around to some of my favorite locations and reveled in the fact that I could basically tour the city with no effort.\n\nThen I decided to jump over to Arches National Park in Utah. I had no idea where on the map it was, but I was able to take a shortcut to it using the built-in menu that I launched from the controller. When I arrived, which took about 20 seconds total, I was in awe of the scenery. I felt like Dr. Manhattan in Watchman when he flees to Mars to ponder the meaning of life. I, too, have been in a reflective state, and as I stared out into the dessert, I was able to disconnect from the reality that I was actually sitting in a fluorescent-lit office.\n\nThe whole experience was awesome—until it wasn’t. After spending about 20 minutes touring the globe, jumping around to my favorite cities like New York and Tokyo, and also visiting some nature sites like the Amazon, I got a massive headache. My eyes were completely strained by the transition screen between navigating the spherical globe and walking around on a flat map. My head still hurts as I punch out these words on my keyboard, and to be totally honest, I can’t wait to stop looking at my screen.So it turns out Google Earth VR is an awesome experience, but it’s hampered by some of the same problems that all VR experiences are. In short, if you play around in the headset for too long, your eyes and and your head will start to hate you. So if you’re looking for an easy way to escape, Google Earth VR is something you should legitimately consider trying—just don’t wander the globe for too long.","description":"Let’s be real: It’s been a pretty stressful year.

Realizing that the biggest challenge for a bi-pedal robot was still the constant pull of gravity, Hong wanted to experiment with a bot that wasn’t always at risk of falling over and breaking.BALLU’s helium-filled mylar torso isn’t completely weightless, it does rely on its legs to remain upright. But it’s so incredibly light its legs are almost twig-like, with basic cable-driven knees allowing it to walk forwards, backwards, and left or right. It’s remarkably stable on its feet as a result of its balloon body, and it can even walk across water without sinking and frying all of its electronics.A robot that can be defeated with a couple of safety pins and pruning shears should give humanity a sigh of relief about the future, but what good would a bot like BALLU be in terms of practical functionality? A larger balloon torso would give it enough lift to carry sensors or other simple tools into areas too dangerous for humans to tread.

Dubbed “Poison Tap,” Kamar’s new home brew device allows someone to plant a backdoor on a computer in just one minute, even when the device is locked.\n\nKamar’s method for installing the backdoor is unconventional and totally ingenious. Poison Tap targets the victim’s browser cache and injects the malicious code there. Traditionally, attacks would attempt to install malware onto the computer, but by instead going after the browser cache, Poison Tap can bypass some security measures and anti-virus software. Poison Tap’s software runs off of a a microSD card inserted into a $5 Raspberry Pi. Once it is plugged in, Poison Tap acts as if it was Ethernet to USB device and its setting make it so that the computer begins to send network traffic to Poision Tap, hijacking all network traffic. From there, it “siphons and stores” cookies and session from the web browser of just about every website. Then Poison Tap gains access to the computer’s internal router, and it’s game over. An attacker can now remotely send code to the victim’s computer via the web. Once Poison Tap is unplugged, the backdoor stays on the computer, allowing an attacker essentially unmitigated access to the victim’s computer.\n\nSamy Kamar\n\nKamar has publicly released the source code to Poision Tap, so that any would-be hacker can try it out for themselves. The best way to protect yourself, Kamar says, is to encrypt your computer and it put it into sleep mode whenever you walk away from it.

Here’s what caused this gruesome fishpocalypse.\n\nThese bunker fish, also known as menhaden fish, weren’t killed by toxic algae or industrial waste. Rather, they were starved of oxygen. Like mammals, fish need oxygen to survive, and as owners of aquariums know, the water in which fish reside must contain plentiful amounts of this life-giving gas. According to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, the fish were fleeing a predatory school of bluefish when they wandered into the canal. Unfortunately for the fish, the canal was closed for the night, creating a dead end. The ever-crowding conditions resulted in rapid depletion of oxygen in the water. Thousands of fish were asphyxiated, creating a blanket of stinky corpses across the surface of the canal. When the locks were opened the next morning, many of the dead fish floated back out to sea, or were washed up on shore. Some fish even managed to make it out alive. A number of fisherman arrived at the scene to scoop up some of the popular bait fish, which they’ll use to trap lobster and capture sea bass. As a precaution, the county’s health department is collecting water samples to test for pathogens and pesticides.","description":"Earlier this week, an unforgettable sight greeted the residents of Hampton Bays, New York, as  thousands upon thousands of dead bunker fish filled the Shinnecock Canal.

Image: NASA/New Horizons\n\nFour billion years ago, an asteroid the size of Manhattan smacked into Pluto, punching out a crater that filled up with ice from above and water from below, eventually becoming so heavy it caused the entire planet to tip over.\n\nThat, at least, is the general takeaway from two new scientific papers published today in the journal Nature. Each paper seeks to explain how Sputnik Planitia—the brilliant, ice filled basin affectionately called the “left lobe” of Pluto’s heart—formed and evolved over time. Together, the two studies tell a remarkable, almost fantastical origin story involving giant asteroids, buried oceans, and exotic ices that twisted entire worlds upside down in eons past.While the papers agree on the broad brushstrokes and diverge on the details of how Sputnik Planitia came to be, neither analysis is complete or irrefutable. The truth about Pluto’s icy heart possibly lies somewhere in the middle.\n\nA 600-mile-wide, teardrop-shaped basin that is believed to have formed during an ancient impact, Sputnik Planitia has received more attention than any other geologic feature spotted on Pluto during the New Horizons flyby. And for good reason: Pluto’s shiny left lobe is downright astonishing. Flat, smooth, and brilliant, this vast, icy plain features virtually no craters, suggesting the surface has been renewing itself since it was formed. In other words, Pluto is geologically active.\n\nBut while Sputnik Planitia revealed things about the former ninth planet we never expected to learn, its location, at Pluto’s equator, posed a mystery.“If you drew a line from the center of Charon through Pluto, it would come out on the far side right near Sputnik Planitia,” said James Keane, a doctoral student at the University of Arizona’s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. “That line is called the tidal axis. Anytime in planetary science that we see a connection between a large geologic feature and this special axes, it’s basically a hallmark of a process called true polar wander.”True polar wander, or the re-orientation of a planet with respect to its axis of rotation, occurs because planets, like all other objects, prefer to spin in the way that minimizes energy. If you stuck a wad of gum on a toy top, it would cause the top to tip over until it reached a new, minimum energy spin axis. Likewise, if you add a bunch of mass to a planet’s north pole, the extra weight will tug that pole toward the equator.\n\nWe see evidence of true polar wander all over the solar system. On Mars, a vast mountain belt—something planetary scientists call a “positive mass anomaly”—sits squarely on the equator. On Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a chain of geysers are spewing seawater into space, producing a negative mass anomaly that happens to lie right at the south pole. In both cases, when weight was added or subtracted, the celestial body reoriented to compensate.Sputnik Planitia’s equatorial location suggests the basin is heavy—so heavy it caused the entire planet to tip over. “The assumption is that it’s a positive mass anomaly,” Keane said.\n\nBut this is all rather odd, because remember, we think Sputnik Planitia formed when a rogue space rock smacked into Pluto. Collisions like this tend to eject mass out of a basin, meaning something must have added a lot of weight back in—but what?\n\nAnimation showing how Pluto might have re-oriented itself in response to volatile ices accumulating in Sputnik Planitia. Image: James Tuttle Keane. Maps of Pluto and Charon by NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute.\n\nThat’s where the new studies comes in. Keane’s analysis, which used computer simulations to imagine where Sputnik Planitia formed and how it migrated over time, indicates that an accumulation of volatile ices, namely nitrogen, methane and carbon monoxide, has made Pluto’s heart heavy.“Pluto has really extreme seasons, and volatile ices migrate around the surface on seasonal timescales,” Keane explained, adding that topographic depressions like Sputnik Planitia are cold traps, encouraging ices to settle out. “Our idea is that this basin formed up north, some fifty to sixty degrees away from its present location, and as each season went by, more ice got trapped, causing the basin to reorient toward the equator.”\n\nKeane’s models indicate that Sputnik Planitia has accumulated enough volatiles to yield a several-mile thick sheet of ice. Fault networks on Pluto’s surface support the idea that this icy mantle has been migrating in a southeasterly direction over time, tugging the rest of the dwarf planet along with it.Still, Keane admits, it is hard to image a scenario in which ice alone caused Pluto to tip over. “You’d need many tens or hundreds of kilometers of it,” he said.\n\nPluto, with annotated fault scars that provide evidence of true polar wander. Image:James Tuttle Keane\n\nFrancis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at UC Santa Cruz who led the other study out today in Nature, has a slightly different take on Sputnik Planitia that may solve this problem. Whereas Keane’s study focuses on the power of ice, Nimmo’s model simulations indicate that a slushy, subsurface ocean did most of the heavy lifting that caused Pluto to roll over.\n\nPlanetary scientists have long suspected that at some point, Pluto had a deeply buried, liquid water ocean, kept warm by the heat of radioactive elements in the dwarf planet’s core. According to Nimmo’s analysis, after Sputnik Planitia was carved out, the topographic depression would have started to rebound, drawing water up from this underground reservoir.“If you remove a big chunk of ice from the surface, you’re removing a lot of overburden,” Nimmo explained. “What happens then is that water underneath pushes up on the remaining ice, and rises up. And because water is denser than ice, that gives you some extra mass.”\n\nComparison of mantle uplift in the Moon’s Orientale Basin with proposed ocean uplift in Sputnik Planitia. Image: James Tuttle Keane\n\nNimmo estimates that Sputnik Planitia’s slushy ocean is up to 60 miles (100 kilometers) deep, and buried beneath another 120 miles (200 kilometers) of ice. The ocean is probably filled with ammonia salts, he said, which not only act as antifreeze, they increase the density of the water, making Pluto’s heart even heaver.\n\nBoth researchers were quick to point out that their hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and that in fact, a combination of ice and water were probably responsible for Pluto’s big stumble. “Both of us agree that this reorientation happened, and that Sputnik Planitia has extra mass,” Nimmo said.\n\n“Like all things in science, it’s probably a little bit of both,” Keane added. “Volatiles, oceans, and things we haven’t explored in detail.”Unfortunately, the best way to confirm Keane and Nimmo’s theories is through detailed gravity measurements, and to get those, we’re going to need to stick a probe in orbit around Pluto. Given that such a mission is not even on the drawing board yet, it’s safe to say we’re going to be pondering the origin of Pluto’s heart for a long time.\n\nMeanwhile, New Horizons continues to sail away from the Sun, and is on track to rendezvous with a mysterious red Kuiper Belt Object, MU69, in 2019. No doubt, the spacecraft’s second flyby will uncover more wonders and continue to upend everything we thought we knew about the outer solar system.","description":"Four billion years ago, an asteroid the size of Manhattan smacked into Pluto, punching out a crater that filled up with ice from above and water from below, eventually becoming so heavy it caused the entire planet to tip over.","keywords":"Pluto, space, astronomy, planetary science, science, Gizmodo","time":1479324060,"url":"http://gizmodo.com/how-pluto-got-its-heart-1789026504"},{"title":"Cosplayer Who Dresses Up as X-Men Heroines Says 'Why Let the Gender of a Character Stop You?'","body":"Cosplayer Who Dresses Up as X-Men Heroines Says 'Why Let the Gender of a Character Stop You?'Yesterday 1:25pmEmma Frost can read minds and turn into a nigh-indestructible diamond person.

At the time, the late musician lauded the streaming platform’s commitment to “the effort that real musicians put in 2 their craft 2 achieve the very best they can at this pivotal time in the music industry.” That all went to pieces on Tuesday, however, after Prince’s record label filed a federal lawsuit against Roc Nation, Tidal’s parent company.\n\nThe lawsuit, which was filed in Minnesota, accuses Roc Nation and Tidal of copyright infringement, claiming that Tidal streamed Prince’s music without permission after his death. According to the suit, Prince’s NPG Records agreed to give Tidal the exclusive streaming rights to one album—Hit n Run Phase One—for 90 days. But following the singer’s death, Tidal began streaming many of Prince’s other albums, an act the record label characterized as exploitation.Roc Nation, however, apparently disputes this. The lawsuit says that the company filed paperwork claiming that it had “various agreements between the relevant parties” proving the platform had the rights to the music. (The lawsuit says it hasn’t seen any of these “agreements.)\n\nThe two parties have apparently been involved in a back-and-forth for some time, but Tuesday’s lawsuit has escalated matters.The legal mess is further complicated by a recent deal between Prince’s estate and Universal Music Publishing Group in which the latter company was named the “the exclusive worldwide publishing administrator” for all of Prince’s music. Tidal filed paperwork last week that took issue with the agreement, however, and said the previous contract gave it exclusive streaming rights, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported. (We’ve reached out to Tidal, and we’ll update if we hear back.)It’s not yet clear which albums the estate is trying to protect, but as Rolling Stone points out:\n\nOn June 7th, for what would have been Prince’s 58th birthday, Tidal added 15 lesser-known albums from Prince’s catalog—including his Black Album and Crystal Ball—as well as LPs from his “Artist Formerly Known As” period, live albums, the Girl 6 soundtrack and two New Power Generation albums.Read the whole lawsuit here:[Associated Press]","description":"Back in September 2015, Prince released his album Hit n Run Phase One exclusively through Tidal.

It’s a devastating trend, but it’s also a smart one.\n\nI didn’t think the IUD was for me until I began working as an abortion doula and saw doctors recommend the contraceptive day after day to all sorts of patients as an extremely effective, long-lasting but easily reversible, no-regular-maintenance-required option. Since it seemed too good to be true, I figured there must be something wrong with it, otherwise I would have gotten one ages ago. Instead, when I asked my doctor about birth control options when I was 16, she didn’t even mention it.The IUD was introduced to the American public alongside the birth control pill in the sixties and garnered immediate popularity. In the early seventies, over just a few years, an IUD called the Dalkon Shield led to 17 deaths, widespread incidences of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and a massive class action lawsuit in the seventies. Unsurprisingly, the IUD quickly fell out of favor.\n\nIn Europe, where the Dalkon Shield was less common, women continued using IUDs. They remain significantly more popular in most European countries than in the U.S., even as modern iterations have eliminated earlier problems. But today, many doctors still aren’t trained in implantation, insist that IUDs are only for women who’ve already had children (despite evidence to the contrary), and often fail to suggest it to those who’d most benefit, like teenage girls.So, I picked birth control pills at 16 and worried constantly about missing a dose, waited in terror for my period to appear each month, and experienced a few less-than-pleasant side effects. It was hard to keep up with and I didn’t always trust that I’d been methodical enough. When I went to get plan B without my ID—thankfully I was by then eighteen—the (male) pharmacist refused to hand it over. “Come back with an ID,” he said, looking over my shoulder before adding, “Next!” I didn’t move right away. “You want me to have a baby?” I snapped, furiously. “I’ll bring you one in nine fucking months and put it right here on the counter for you to take care of!” I stomped out and later got Plan B from another Duane Reade once I’d found my driver’s permit. Of course, my big statement was marred when, three weeks later, I had to show up at his counter and wait while he refilled my birth control.It became routine to leave a series of increasingly desperate voicemails for my doctor, begging her to write a script even though I hadn’t gotten a physical in ages. In fact, it was complaining about that exact situation that resulted in my IUD implantation. I was between shifts as an abortion doula, hanging out with my boss in her office. “I have one pill left and my doctor hasn’t returned my calls for days,” I said, playing with a mini-speculum she kept on her desk. “Maybe it’s time for you to finally get an IUD,” she said, “Ask Doctor W., she’ll put it in for you.”\n\nI’d been toying with the possibility of getting one for months, but the idea of suddenly having the problem of birth control solved for five years made me jittery with excitement. So, eight years after becoming sexually active, I picked the Mirena, a hormonal option most often recommended by the doctors I worked with. It was supposed to last for five years; the copper IUD lasts twice as long and is hormone free, but it can result in heavier or more painful periods. When I asked one doctor if she’d implant one after our shift together, she told me to meet her in the exam room with my insurance card at 6:00. I was honestly a bit terrified. I took two Advil, spread my legs and tried to take measured deep breathes. “It hurts a lot, but then it’s over,” she said, “tell me when you want to begin.” In Jezebel, Jenna Sauers wrote that getting her IUD felt like “someone throwing darts at my cervix.” I’ve yet to find a better description than that. After the pretty painful insertion, I treated myself to a cab home and rode uptown with my jeans undone in the backseat. For a couple of days I felt a vauge stabbing feeling in my uterus, then I didn’t really feel much. My period disappeared for a few months, when it came back it was lighter and less cramp-y.\n\nThe most lasting side effect writer Kat Stoeffel observed was the “quasi-religious fervor” of women who get them. I’m definitely one of Stoeffel’s “IUD evangelicals;” I’ve converted a handful of friends and am hoping my twin cousins will both get one before they start college next year.\n\nBut the IUD is about more than convenience. Before getting one, I’d accepted fear as an essential component of sex. It wasn’t until after I had a more than 99% effective form of birth control working away without my doing or forgetting to do anything that I began to finally began to tease those two things apart. Even though I didn’t start having sex until I was on birth control, I immediately learned that the punishment for sex was the fear of possible pregnancy. On the day of my graduation, I remember thinking, Okay, at least I didn’t get pregnant in high school. I wish at 16 my doctor had told me I could have sex without fear of pregnancy and that an IUD was a great way to achieve that. For a number of women I saw come in and out of the hospital, the biggest appeal of the IUD wasn’t necessarily its effectiveness, but its undetectability. That women undergoing abortions for unplanned pregnancies are forced to prize the ability to secretly use birth control over how effective a given method is speaks to the devastating reality of reproductive coercion. “Who’s picking you up today?” I would ask women in for abortions to suss out whether a teenage girl could rely on her mom or if the nervous-looking woman had to hide the procedure from her partner. There were other signs too. A woman would ask how soon she could have sex, and when told to wait two or three weeks, would wince. Sex wasn’t a choice for her. A teen girl in for her second abortion would shake her head to condoms, pills, patches, but then raise her eyes from the floor when the doctor said no one would find out she had an IUD. Carrying any confirmation of her sexual activity endangered her life with parents who constantly went through her things. (The IUD strings soften with time, but some women do report that their partners feel them; a doctor can clip them shorter if need be.)\n\nIf you’re under 25 or childless, your own doctor may give you a hard time or try to steer you in a different direction, so arm yourself with information. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists have called IUDs the best form of birth control for both women and adolescents. You’ll have a better shot of getting an IUD inserted at a Planned Parenthood or a hospital based clinic than at a small practice of a doctor; they’ll also probably be more experienced inserting them. A lot of those considering the IUD seem worried that they’ll get it, hate it, and then be stuck dealing with it for years. That’s not the case, but you should still read up on possible side effects. Most doctors recommend trying the IUD for six months before requesting a removal, since any side effects will usually even out by then. But you can get it taken out whenever you want and removal itself is generally less painful than insertion. You cough while the doctor pulls the small strings, the IUD’s arms fold up, and it slips out. Cramping and discomfort is normal. There’s no way to get around the fact that insertion is painful. But you know what else is unbearable? Waiting in line every single month in the fluorescent-lit basement of Duane Reade for a birth control prescription refill. My insurance wouldn’t allow me to pick up more than a month at a time, and it usually took twenty minutes and most always induced a boiling rage. During the five year lifespan of my IUD, I’m saving 20 hours of facetime at Duane Reade. And, on some insurances, the IUD is completely free.\n\nAnother big concern I’ve heard is the fear that a sexual partner will be able to feel it, or, as one patient in for an abortion asked, “Isn’t it going to poke my boyfriend’s dick?” No. The IUD is inside the uterus where dicks and dildos and hands do not go. The only part of the IUD outside of the uterus is the small strings, which are largely undetectable. Even though IUDs tend to be the most cost effective form of birth control over time, they do have a high upfront cost. Thankfully, they’re currently free with Medicaid. Here’s a breakdown of costs for those with varying levels of insurance. A number of insurance providers don’t cover removal, which is fucked up because it makes women feel entirely stuck in their choice and drives them away from what should be a reversible one. That said, if you’re getting it switched out for a new one or changing to a different form of birth control, it’s possible you won’t be charged for the removal. Prices can vary pretty widely, so call around. Getting an IUD was a really positive experience for me, but I recognize that considering an IUD because of the current circumstances is less than thrilling. It’s sad to see fear drive a decision that can bring about such a sense of power. And sadder still that terror in being detected controlling reproduction has driven many women to the IUD in the past. Even if panic drives the decision, there’s strength to be found in taking care and control of our bodies.\n\nAlex Ronan is a writer from New York now living in Berlin.

But Monday’s magnitude-7.8 earthquake, centered near Kaikoura, sixty miles north of Christchurch, was a brutal reminder that, beneath its verdant carpet, New Zealand is still under active construction. It occupies one of the most complex geologic venues on the globe, at the messy boundary of two tectonic plates. The North Island, where the capital, Wellington, lies, is part of the Australian plate, and its landscape is dominated by two dozen active volcanoes. (One of these, the Taupo caldera, is notorious in the annals of volcanology as the site of Earth’s most recent super-eruption, twenty-six thousand years ago, which covered parts of the island in ejecta six hundred feet deep. Outside geophysical circles, the region is more generally famous as the home of Mt. Doom in the “Lord of the Rings” films.) The plate boundary lies about forty miles offshore, at the Hikurangi trench, a deep warp in the ocean floor where the Pacific crust slides westward beneath the Australian plate. Meanwhile, off the southern end of the South Island, the configuration is reversed—that is, the Australian plate sinks eastward beneath the Pacific plate. In between these two mirror-image subduction zones lies the South Island, which acts as a tectonic intermediary, accommodating the differential motion via a complex system of faults, like a team of diplomats doing their best to avert a head-on collision between superpowers. The main mediating structure in the South Island is the Alpine Fault, a boundary in some ways analogous to California’s San Andreas Fault. As on the San Andreas, the sense of slip on the Alpine is right lateral—like the motion of cars, as viewed from above, on a two-lane road in New Zealand, which retains the British practice of driving on the left. The Alpine displaces rocks on either side horizontally by about an inch and a half per year, which amounts to roughly a hundred feet of offset since the Maori arrived, in the thirteenth century, or more than three hundred miles over the life of the fault. Given the Alpine Fault’s setting, in the vise between two converging plates, it must also absorb a large amount of tectonic squeezing. This forces rocks in the Pacific plate upward at a rate of almost half an inch per year, and over time this has formed the spine of the South Island, the Southern Alps. (They would be the fastest-rising mountain belt in the world if only the rain on their western slopes weren’t so efficient at eroding them away again.) The South Island in fact owes its very existence to the Alpine Fault, which raises submerged rocks above sea level. One of New Zealand’s geologic peculiarities is that its continental shelf—the relatively shallow seabed surrounding it—is about eighteen times larger than its land area. This portion of the crust was once attached to Australia (a fact that many Kiwis may be reluctant to acknowledge) but rifted away in Cretaceous time to form a separate block. Some geologists even argue that it ought to be considered an eighth continent, Zealandia. As long as the current plate configuration and rates of uplift persist (and continue to outstrip sea-level rise), more of Zealandia will emerge from the ocean in the future. If the South Island as a whole bears the brunt of the complex relationship between the Australian and Pacific plates, its northern end, where this week’s earthquake occurred, is the very pivot point where the subduction zone transitions into the Alpine Fault. Tremors are therefore common in this region, but the November 14th event was the largest since 1929 and the first of this magnitude to be monitored with modern geophysical instruments. A preliminary interpretation of the seismic records suggests that the earthquake, like the one that devastated Christchurch in 2010, was a composite event—in other words, it involved slip on more than one fault. One line of evidence for this is the unusually long duration of the slip (about two minutes) and the fact that the main energy release happened not at the onset, as is typical in single-fault failures, but more than forty seconds later. The spatial pattern of the first-arriving seismic waves also points to an untidy, multiple-fault mechanism. A major concern now is how the earthquake may be related to stresses on the subduction zone itself, and whether this event portends something disastrous along the Hikurangi trench, which has been unusually quiet compared with other subduction zones around the Pacific rim. Remarkably, this powerful tremor appears to have caused only two deaths, in part because it occurred in a rural area in the middle of the night. Outside urban areas, its primary effect was to trigger large landslides that blocked transportation arteries, including the main highway and rail line along the northeast coast of the South Island. This lends credence to the emerging paradigm that sublime landscapes like New Zealand’s are shaped not by the gradual processes traditionally invoked by geologists but by violent, episodic upheavals that shake the seemingly tranquil hills occupied by sheep and humans alike.","description":"Marcia Bjornerud reports on the magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck New Zealand on November 14, 2016, and what it says about the country’s geology.","keywords":"","time":1479249475,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/new-zealands-tectonic-dragon-awakens?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Death Valley Is Alive","body":"Death Valley, the majestically desolate national park on the eastern edge of California, is a rain-shadow desert, meaning that nearby mountain ranges drain moisture from incoming weather systems and stop rain from reaching the other side. Eighty miles to the west is the Sierra Nevada range, the highest in the contiguous forty-eight states, rising to fourteen thousand five hundred feet. Close by are the jagged Panamints, which reach eleven thousand feet. Any system that can carry water across those barriers is a freak occurrence. The dryness of the region is compounded by the depression of the valley floor—as low as two hundred and eighty-two feet below sea level. Whatever rain gets in tends to evaporate as it descends to the sunken bottom. In summer, nothing stands in the way of extreme heat. In 1913, a weather observer reported a temperature of a hundred and thirty-four degrees—still the official world record. Some meteorologists doubt that measurement, but even without it Death Valley would remain one of the hottest places on Earth. The shadow lifted in October of last year, when several storms struck Death Valley National Park, resulting in what the U.S. Geological Survey called a “thousand-year-flood event.” At Scotty’s Castle, a Mission Revival villa that an eccentric millionaire built in the north of the park in the nineteen-twenties, three inches of rain fell in five hours. The deluge tore up roads and carried Dumpsters for miles. In a flashback to the Ice Age, when a lake filled the valley, a shallow body of water covered the basin for several weeks. Because of the rain, Death Valley experienced what came to be called the Superbloom: cascades of wildflowers across thousands of acres. Park rangers had predicted an exceptional flowering after the October storms, but they were unprepared for the intensity of the public response. The park usually receives about a million visitors each year. In March alone, more than two hundred thousand people came through. No mania in the bizarre history of Death Valley—the prospectors and swindlers of the late nineteenth century; the playboy adventurers and car racers of the Jazz Age; the psychedelic goings on in the sixties and seventies, including a residency by the Manson family—matched the Superbloom invasion. In early March, when the bloom was at its height, I drove from Los Angeles to Beatty, Nevada, northeast of the park, and checked in at a Motel 6. “This thing with the flowers, it’s crazy,” the man on night duty said. “The town can’t handle it. Restaurants are running out of food, having to get supplies from Pahrump or Vegas.” Just before sunrise, I drove into the park. As the mountaintops lit up, I thought of Willa Cather’s description of a desert morning: “The world is golden in an instant.” I went through Daylight Pass, and the entire expanse of Death Valley sprang into view: the dark mountains, the white floor, the perpetual mirage of an ancient lake. Snow capped the Panamints. Few places on the planet offer a more dramatic juxtaposition of extremes: the climate ranges from desert to subarctic conditions. The valley shimmered with myriad points of color, as if Georges Seurat had touched up a Georgia O’Keeffe. The dominant presence was desert gold, a sunflower that blossoms on a long, spindly stem. Notch-leaved phacelia, in colors ranging from blue to lavender, were also common, along with the free-floating white blossoms known as gravel ghosts. Scarlet clusters of paintbrush spattered higher elevations. The flowers were especially thick along the shoulders of the roads, since runoff soaks the ground on either side. They seemed to greet you as you went by, like bystanders cheering a parade—or, perhaps, like protesters silently resisting the incursion of asphalt. As the day went on, the landscape was overrun by people. They moved through the fields in slow motion, their legs extended at funny angles, their heads bent down. From a distance, they appeared to be playing Twister or performing modern dance. Once I got off the road, I understood why people were contorting themselves. You did not want to step on any of the brave little blooms that were coming up in this unlikely terrain: bone-dry sandy soil, cracked sheets of dried mud, patches of soil on the ledges of cliffs. The desert-five-spot flower looks up at you with a tiny, bright-painted face—purple petals speckled with red. All that color has a practical purpose: to seize the attention of hummingbirds and other pollinators. But it was hard not to see it symbolically, as a defiant assertion of life in the face of death. Such a conceit assumes that there is something inherently deadly about Death Valley. The name was coined by gold-seekers who passed through in 1849 and 1850. They had a difficult time, and as the survivors escaped over the Panamints one of them exclaimed, “Goodbye, Death Valley!” He probably had the Biblical psalm in mind: “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death.” Since then, macabre nomenclature has been in vogue: the Black Mountains, the Funeral Mountains, Coffin Canyon, Devil’s Golf Course, Dante’s View. The first overlook on the drive in from Beatty is called Hells Gate. Yet Death Valley is no more lethal than any other stretch of wilderness. On average, there are one or two fatalities a year, mostly from car accidents. Members of the Timbisha Shoshone tribe, who have lived in the area for hundreds of years, call the place Timbisha, after a red ochre that their ancestors used as body paint. For them, death became a looming presence only when the first white men arrived. In Death Valley, life does keep a low profile. Often, it is latent: seeds stay in the soil for years, waiting for a deluge to awaken them. Or it is hidden, as in the isolated pockets of water where desert pupfish—survivors of the Ice Age lakes—dart about. The feminist adventurer Edna Brush Perkins, whose 1922 book “The White Heart of Mojave” is among the best of the many Death Valley travelogues, wrote, “The desert mixes up your ideas about what you call living and dying. You see the dreadful, dead country living in beauty, and feel that the silence pressing around it is alive.” Some years ago, I succumbed to what Perkins called, not without irony, the “terrible fascination” of Death Valley. I was lured by the spooky clichés; I’d read “Helter Skelter,” which describes how the Manson family ran amok while hiding out at Barker Ranch, in the park’s southwest corner. (Manson was apprehended when members of his gang set fire to a piece of Park Service earthmoving equipment, prompting rangers to investigate.) After a few days in the region, I lost interest in all that. I realized that Death Valley is not so much a desert as a surreally varied mountain region with a desert at its heart. At first sight, the landscape seems fixed and timeless, but you soon sense that there was violent change in the not so distant past. Vistas rearrange themselves kaleidoscopically as pastel-colored geologic formations move in and out of view. Vast slabs of rock descend into the earth at severe angles, like the Titanic making its fatal dive. I took a photograph of a stretch of two-lane highway, with sky, mountains, desert, and asphalt forming a geometric abstraction. The image haunted me, becoming the desktop picture on my computer. I have gone back to Death Valley every so often, and this year I have made a series of visits, trying to better understand its allure. Almost everything anomalous about the place—its climate, its ecology, its history—is the result of its geology. It belongs to a region known as the Basin and Range, which passes between the Rockies and the Sierra Nevada. Here the earth’s crust is being pulled apart: in some areas, blocks have been shoved upward, forming mountain outcrops, and in others the blocks have fallen, forming a basin. Hence the vertiginous, two-mile drop from Telescope Peak, the highest of the Panamints, to Badwater Basin, the low point of the valley. Earthquakes are frequent, and in the past few thousand years there has been volcanic activity in Ubehebe Crater, one of the more unearthly features of the park. In geologic time, all this happened just the other day: the Death Valley that we see now did not begin to form until about three million years ago. It has a raw, chaotic look, like an unfinished construction project. One weekend in April, I rented a Jeep Wrangler and toured the park with Darrel Cowan, a professor of geology at the University of Washington. A weathered, fit seventy-one-year-old, he is a native of Los Angeles, and first saw Death Valley as a child, while on a family vacation. He returned in college, when he took a field trip with a geology class. “I was amazed to realize that I could make a living wandering through this kind of landscape,” he told me. A few years ago, he and his brother bought a small house in Shoshone, California, a pleasant roadside village on the eastern edge of the park. He goes there several times a year, often bringing students with him. We first drove down the Badwater Road, which winds along the foot of the Black Mountains. At Badwater Basin, we stopped to survey the terrain. Nestled in the rock face high above us was a sign reading “SEA LEVEL,” in white block lettering reminiscent of the Hollywood sign. “The actual bedrock is much lower,” Cowan told me. “It goes three or four kilometres beneath our feet. There’s layer upon layer of sediment on top.” Cowan turned to the Panamints, on the far side of the flats. “See that dark-green coloring, below Telescope Peak? That’s high-altitude vegetation—piñon and juniper. The stratigraphy of the rock up there is well known: middle Paleozoic going into Proterozoic. The strange thing is that all those elements”—he turned back to the slope above us—“are missing from the Black Mountains. They should be here, but they aren’t. The provocative theory is that the Panamints used to be on top of the Black Mountains and then moved.” He put his left hand on top of his right and slid it to one side, forming a cleft. “I used to think it was a crazy idea, but I’m liking it more and more.” We drove across the flats, leaving a plume of dust in our wake. On the other side, we went up the Hanaupah Canyon road, a rocky trail that justified the use of a jeep. In this area, Cowan and a colleague, Paul Bodin, had conducted an experiment designed to test for seismic activity along Death Valley’s faults. They deployed ten seismometers on the east side of the Panamints and monitored data for eighteen months. The devices recorded man-made tremors—the rumbling of off-road vehicles, blasts from mines outside the park—and more than three hundred “microearthquakes.” Indeed, the mountain-moving forces remain active. The Panamints are probably still rising; Death Valley will only get drier and hotter. The following day, we drove through Titus Canyon, one of the park’s glories. You approach from the Nevada side, over the Grapevine Mountains. You pass a ghost town called Leadfield, where an alleged hundred-million-dollar silver-lead mine created hysteria in the twenties. (The mine was ballyhooed in Jazz Age lingo: “She’s a ‘High Stepping Baby’ and I don’t mean maybe.”) Then comes a two-thousand-foot descent down an increasingly narrow canyon, with tilting towers of rock on all sides. Cowan pointed out multicolored formations that are characteristic of the area: Bonanza King, Carrara, Zabriskie Quartzite. “But see how it’s folded—bent this way and that, turned upside down?” he said, shaking his head. “How did you do that to these thick limestones?” A Subaru clattered by, risking a flat tire on the rough road. “Stop and look at the rocks!” Cowan mock-shouted. He became fixated on a striking complex of dark-gray limestone blocks surrounded by whitish calcite, a shattered geometry reminiscent of a Futurist composition. “You can see how these blocks once fit together and then were pulled apart. Sometimes it’s like there was an explosion and all these pieces just blew off. And, over there, these really massive blocks, just floating. I’ve never seen anything like this.” Cowan mentioned a 1941 study by the geologist Levi Noble, who was the first to decipher the roiling processes at work in Death Valley. Noble coined the term “Amargosa chaos” to describe the folding and twisting of rock formations. (The Amargosa is a river that flows from southern Nevada to Badwater Basin, largely underground.) Noble wrote, “The fantastic disorder of the rock masses that form the precipitous mountain ranges bordering Death Valley imparts a quality of strangeness to the scenery that is felt even by the casual visitor.” “I don’t mean to dis the Grand Canyon,” Cowan said, with a laugh. “But, compared with this, it’s monotonous. There you have all the layers beautifully stacked up, the oldest on the bottom and the youngest on top. It’s the same thing the whole way through. This is dynamic.” Geologists aren’t the only scientists who see vitality amid the barrenness of Death Valley. Biologists and ecologists go there to study the stubborn persistence of various life-forms, from microbes to mammals. For these researchers, the so-called Superbloom was of no great note; it simply made visible life that is always present. Exobiologists—scientists who theorize about the possibility of extraterrestrial life—have taken particular interest in the place. If you can make it here, it might be said, you can make it almost anywhere. Generations of tourists have compared Death Valley to Mars. For several years, the park has capitalized on its far-out reputation by hosting an event called MarsFest, in which the public can listen to presentations by members of NASA and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute, and by affiliated scientists. This year’s edition, held in April, was renamed the Celestial Centennial, in honor of the centennial of the National Park Service. One of the speakers was the NASA researcher Christopher McKay, who is helping to plan a Martian rover mission in 2020. (NASA has a history of testing rovers in Death Valley.) Several hundred people turned out for lectures and field trips. At night, amateur astronomers set up telescopes in Furnace Creek, an oasis village where the Park Service has its local headquarters. In a matter of minutes, I caught glimpses of Mercury, four of Jupiter’s moons, the Messier 3 star cluster, and the Whirlpool Galaxy. At Badwater Basin that morning, a couple of dozen people—mostly of a type that might be described as Tourists with Autodidact Tendencies—gathered to hear a lecture by Susanne Douglas, a biologist who teaches at East Los Angeles College and has also been associated with NASA. Her specialty is communities of organisms that thrive in conditions that seem extreme from a human standpoint. On trips to Death Valley, Douglas has examined the microbial life that can be found in the flats, where millennia of flooding and evaporation have left an encrustation of salt. Although there is water here—three groups of pools are fed by springs flowing under the Black Mountains—most species cannot handle the high levels of salt and boron. “In the summer, the ground temperature can approach two hundred degrees,” Douglas said. “But the microbes actually grow better in extreme heat. Some can live without light, and some can live without oxygen. They obtain their energy from minerals.” Each of the three Badwater pools has a unique network of microbes, depending on the minerals that are present in the ground. Douglas ventured out onto the salt flats with three of her students, stepping off the walkways provided for tourists. A park ranger commented, “She’s pretty much the only person who’s allowed to do that.” She brought back a few samples from the deposits. They were streaked with color: green, orange, purple, and black. The orange, she explained, acts as a sunscreen, protecting the green layer underneath. The bacteria feed on the deposits and alter their chemistry. Gypsum, which can create bulbous, cauliflowerlike forms, transforms into sulfur, and then into a sulfur variant known as rosickyite. “The rosickyite is what jumps out,” Douglas went on. “Geologically, it should never have been here. You usually find it only at a volcanic pit or a hydrothermal vent. Microbes make it stable.” If such a mineral were to be seen on Mars, it might signal the former presence of microbial life. In her work with NASA, Douglas has tested the Mars rovers’ instruments on Badwater samples, to see how well they detect the biosignatures. The drying up of Death Valley’s lakes after the last Ice Age killed off almost all aquatic vertebrates except for the pupfish—minnowlike creatures less than two inches long. They persist in Salt Creek, a few miles north of Badwater, and several other pockets of water in the region. As the desert advanced, the pupfish evolved in such a way that they could withstand high salinity and water temperatures exceeding a hundred degrees. When I visited Salt Creek this spring, the breeding season had just begun. The males, like the wildflowers, showed brilliant colors: yellow at the head, iridescent blue at the tail. Elsewhere, Death Valley shelters potentially endangered organisms. In Lee Flat, an elevated plain in the northwest part of the park, Joshua trees dot the landscape. A few are elderly giants, their thick trunks coated with fibrous matter; many others are striplings, with a few tufts of green atop a short trunk. The tiniest ones resemble pineapples. The biologist James Cornett, who has studied the Lee Flat grove for twenty-one years, sees evidence of a demographic shift. Young trees—“new recruits,” he calls them—are increasing in number. For various reasons, including higher altitude, Lee Flat trees are healthier than the ones in Joshua Tree National Park, to the south, where rising temperatures and drought are depleting the youngsters. Cornett believes that a century from now, if current trends continue, Death Valley’s Joshua trees will be the primary California population. All living things in Death Valley dwell in the shadow of the human presence. The ultimate threat comes from Las Vegas, a hundred and twenty miles to the southeast. As the biologist Christopher Norment writes, in his 2014 book, “Relicts of a Beautiful Sea: Survival, Extinction, and Conservation in a Desert World,” the Southern Nevada Water Authority has proposed pumping groundwater that feeds into the Death Valley ecosystem. The authority has agreed to “avoid unreasonable adverse effects,” yet no one has defined what those effects might be. Would the extinction of the pupfish be too great a price? Norment thinks so. “We need their beauty and otherness, their delicate and fragile strength,” he writes. “We need the refugee species, the discards that ask for nothing more than the home that each and every one of us desires.” Death Valley got its name because early white settlers had no idea how to live in it. The history of non-Native people in the region is, for the most part, a stunning panorama of hubris and stupidity. The definitive treatment of the subject is “Death Valley and the Amargosa: A Land of Illusion,” a 1986 book by Richard E. Lingenfelter, an astrophysicist who moonlights as a historian of the Old West. (His other works include the paper “Is There a Dark Matter Signal in the Galactic Positron Annihilation Radiation?”) The chief illusion was that Death Valley could be mined for gold, silver, and other marketable metals. There were such reserves, but the expense involved in extracting them usually exceeded their value. The dream of wealth was made all the more romantic by tales of death-defying adventure. One early chronicler claimed to have seen white sands strewn with skeletons; another conjured poisonous dust clouds swooping over fields of glittering gems. The saga began with a wrong turn. In 1849, at the height of the gold rush, a wagon train with as many as a thousand people was making its way from Salt Lake City to Nevada and California. One group, misled by a largely imaginary map, attempted a shortcut through Death Valley. Some of the pioneers escaped alive; others perished. A sizable number, including families, were trapped for weeks in Furnace Creek. Two young men, John Rogers and William Lewis Manly, found a path across the Panamints, then returned with supplies to rescue the party. Manly’s memories of Death Valley were less than fond: “If the waves of the sea could flow in and cover its barren nakedness . . . it would be indeed a blessing, for in it there is naught of good, comfort or satisfaction, but ever in the minds of those who braved its heat and sands, a thought of a horrid Charnel house.” He might have been happy to know that his name is now affixed to Death Valley’s Ice Age lake, which covered the charnel house in waters six hundred feet deep. Several forty-niners glimpsed precious metal as they dragged themselves over the mountains. One survivor later fashioned a gun sight from a hunk of silver; this engendered the legend of the Gunsight Lode, which prospectors pursued for decades. There was said to be a mountain of purest silver, as well as inexhaustible veins of gold, copper, and lead. Such stories attracted con men by the dozen. Geologists were paid to tout gigantic deposits; stock was sold back East; boomtowns sprang up; the hucksters cashed in. Supreme among them was Walter Scott, after whom Scotty’s Castle was named: he parlayed speculation around a nonexistent mine into national celebrity. One of his publicity schemes was a train that he called the Death Valley Coyote. He rode it from Chicago to Los Angeles at record speed, throwing out ten-dollar bills as he went. Few people made honest money from Death Valley mines, at least until the borax business came in, at the turn of the twentieth century. The humble chemical, which forms easily in salt flats, has many household uses, notably as a laundry detergent. Initially, teams of mules were used to carry loads of borax out of the valley. You can still buy boxes of 20 Mule Team Borax, although all mines in the park are now closed. Death Valley became a national monument in the last weeks of the Hoover Administration. In the twilight of power, Hoover seemed drawn to vast, empty spaces: three of the parks he created at that time were deserts. As Hal Rothman and Char Miller note, in the 2013 book “Death Valley National Park: A History,” the notion of a desert park was novel. The classic parks, Yosemite and Yellowstone, matched nineteenth-century ideas of the sublime, their grandiose scenery celebrated by Albert Bierstadt and other landscape painters. In the twentieth century, the epoch of “The Waste Land,” an aesthetic of desolation took hold. Death Valley found its place in artistic lore: Frank Norris’s 1899 novel, “McTeague,” and Erich von Stroheim’s ill-fated 1924 film adaptation, “Greed,” both end with the image of the protagonist handcuffed to a corpse in Badwater Basin. Dozens of movie scenes have given the park a post-apocalyptic or sci-fi tint. R2-D2 meanders down one of its canyons in “Star Wars.” Even if its menace is exaggerated, Death Valley can wipe out those who act foolishly. In 1996, a German couple with two children drove a van up a remote canyon in the Panamints, got stuck, set off on foot, and vanished. Thirteen years later, a retired traffic engineer named Tom Mahood, who specializes in tracking desert disappearances and U.F.O.s, uncovered their remains. In 2001, one of Darryl Cowan’s students found scattered bones in Hanaupah Canyon, with jeans and sneakers nearby; they belonged to a tourist who had gone missing months earlier. Last summer, there were two heat-related fatalities. In June, a German motorcyclist succumbed to heat stroke after parking his vehicle and wandering a short distance. In August, a Las Vegas woman died after her car got stuck in sand. Rangers speak of “death by G.P.S.”: people follow bad directions into oblivion, refusing to believe that their devices could lead them astray. At 3.4 million acres, Death Valley is the largest national park outside of Alaska, yet its annual budget, a little under nine million dollars, is relatively modest. Only eight full-time park police patrol the region, plus a few seasonal hires. Although emergencies arise every week, most of the time police and rangers handle lesser problems: illicit camping, graffiti, unlicensed film projects and car commercials. (“Tested in Death Valley” is a favorite car-ad conceit, going back to a 1916 campaign by the Dodge Brothers.) Inevitably, much of the park goes unsupervised. Rangers tend to take a see-no-evil attitude toward countercultural activity at the hot springs in Saline Valley, which hosts clothing-optional softball games on Presidents’ Day weekend. For some Park Service people, Death Valley can be a gruelling assignment: high schools and shopping are an hour or more away, and for serious medical needs you have to go to Las Vegas. Others thrive on the solitude. In March, I spent a few hours looking at wildflowers with Dianne Milliard, a ranger who had been dividing her time between Death Valley, in the winter, and McCarthy, Alaska, in the summer. “Everyone says that I live in these extreme places,” she told me. “But for me ‘extreme’ would be Chicago—I can’t imagine living in a place like that. I need more space than most people.” We drove through Greenwater Valley, once the scene of a short-lived copper-mining craze. Milliard’s radio crackled to life: “Need a ranger to handle what looks to be a commercial photo shoot happening at the entrance to Twenty Mule Team Canyon.” We walked through fields of wildflowers. “Here’s the little purple Death Valley phacelia, always hiding in the bushes,” Milliard said. She took photographs of choice flowers as she walked along; she had been posting pictures on Death Valley’s Facebook page, along with directions to the best viewing spots. “But I don’t give away everything I see,” she told me. “A very fragile area could get trashed if I sent a lot of people there.” On her days off, Milliard hiked alone or with a colleague in stretches of the park that are overlooked by guidebooks—places she liked to call “nameless canyons.” She told me, “I’m trying to decide where to disappear to this weekend.” The only sensible way of living in Death Valley is the one adopted by the Timbisha Shoshone people, in the centuries before the Manly cohort blundered through. In the winter months, when temperatures tend to peak in the seventies, the Timbisha lived on the flats, at springs like the one in Furnace Creek. In the summers, they avoided the heat by going into the mountains. They hunted game—bighorn sheep were the largest prize—and gathered pine nuts and mesquite beans. In greener parts of the park, such as Saline Valley, they grew potatoes, squash, corn, wheat, and fruit trees. Last summer, I went to see Pauline Esteves, the elder of the Timbisha Shoshone. She was born in Furnace Creek in 1924. Her mother, Rosie, came from a family that had long lived near the spring. Her father, Steve, was of Basque descent; he was a stonemason, and helped to build the Furnace Creek Inn, the only high-end lodging in Death Valley. The Park Service didn’t arrive until Esteves was nine, and she can remember the traditional summertime expeditions into the mountains. She now lives alone in a roomy trailer in the Timbisha village, which lies about a mile south of the Park Service visitors’ center. Around thirty-five people occupy a group of adobe homes and trailers, with mesquite trees providing a modicum of shade. “To call it Death Valley, that was a very immoral and evil thing,” Esteves said, scrutinizing me through black-framed glasses. “We didn’t even talk about death. We talked about now, and the future. Death is part of life—it’s going to happen. Why talk about it? My elders used to ask, ‘What do these people know about death, anyway? How do you define death?’ They’d go into heavy conversations that I’d listen to. Then they’d wind up making a big joke out of it.” She laughed and rolled her eyes. “All these other names: Funeral Mountains, Devil’s Golf Course, Hells Gate. A writer once brought up the idea of changing the name, and people at the Park Service said that it’s part of the folklore. The folklore! What the heck is that?” For the most part, the Timbisha evaded the regime of slaughter and enslavement that caused the Native American population of California to drop from about a hundred and fifty thousand, in 1846, to about sixteen thousand, in 1880. The arrival of the National Park Service posed a new challenge: because the Timbisha were never recognized as a tribe, they had no legal standing when Death Valley became public land. From the start, they felt that the rangers were up to no good; in their uniforms, they looked like soldiers. Esteves recalls, “I never saw really harsh things being done to our people, but we kids rebelled against them, because they intimidated us. We did crazy things. Once, we let the air out of the tires of the rangers’ car when they were giving a lecture to the rich folk at the Furnace Creek Inn, probably saying how we eat snakes.” The Timbisha were right to be suspicious: the Park Service considered their encampment a blemish on the supposed purity of the wilderness. During the Second World War, young men of the tribe joined the armed forces, and often they moved their families out of Death Valley. When an adobe house became unoccupied, a ranger hosed it down until its walls dissolved. The apparent hope was that the tribe would vanish completely, yet the community hung on. In the nineteen-seventies and eighties, Esteves became active in the Timbisha’s efforts to win formal recognition and ownership of land. After tortuous negotiations, the tribe was granted three hundred and fourteen acres at Furnace Creek. In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed the Timbisha Shoshone Homeland Act, and the tribe’s name now appears on Death Valley signage. Once the Timbisha had regained a parcel of their ancestral home, new problems arose. The tribe split into factions, with Esteves and others at Furnace Creek pitted against a larger group, based in Bishop, at the northern end of Owens Valley. The Bishop group, which has assumed control, is pursuing plans for a casino, to be built outside the park. Those in Furnace Creek favor a museum and an environmentally conscious inn. Barbara Durham, Esteves’s niece, serves as the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer, and she maintains a small display of artifacts in the Timbisha office. While I was talking to Durham, a family of Norwegian tourists stopped by. In the summer months, the park gets a lot of business from Europeans, who relish extreme heat of a kind they may never have encountered. (To New Yorkers, the park feels not unlike the lower level of the West Fourth Street subway station on a hundred-degree day.) After the Norwegians left, Durham said, “The Europeans romanticize us. They’ve seen all kinds of versions of us on TV. But they tend to know more about Native American history than the average U.S. citizen.” To gaze at the Panamint Range from the valley floor is to experience an old and dangerous illusion: the mountains do not seem nearly as high or as far off as they really are. “Distant objects look stark and near,” Edna Brush Perkins wrote. “What you judge to be half a mile usually turns out to be five, and four miles is certainly eighteen.” In the blinding light of day, the mass of rock flattens into two dimensions, like a cardboard cutout on a comic-opera set. At sunset, the mountains turn an ethereal blue and purple. When you start walking toward them across the salt pan, they do not appear to get any closer. Your feet move, but you make no progress. I had wondered for years what the view is like from above, and in August I decided to climb Telescope Peak. The hike is a fourteen-mile round trip, and, while it requires no mountaineering abilities, the guidebooks do not lie in calling it strenuous. I drove to Mahogany Flat, a campground just above eight thousand feet, where I spent the night in a tent. Down in the valley, the temperature had hit a hundred and seventeen; up there, it got a bit chilly after dark. I could see no artificial light except, very faintly, the glow of Las Vegas to the east. The night sky blazed so brightly that it was hard to pick out constellations. Sunrise was eerie: a red disk materialized behind mountain haze, and Badwater Basin became visible as a faint white patch. I saw no one else hiking that day. Evidently, I had the mountain to myself. I like spells of solitude, but this was a bit much. I did not lack for company, though. A black-tailed jackrabbit froze in place. A Panamint chipmunk perched atop a rock, its foxlike ears twitching. Lizards darted across the path. I scanned the far ridges for bighorn sheep, but had no luck. From afar, these peaks had appeared forbidding and featureless. Up close, they were startlingly green, their slopes covered by trees, bushes, and flowering plants. The fields below had turned an arid brown by April and May, yet at this elevation the bloom was still in progress: I saw purple lupine, scarlet paintbrush, yellow rabbitbrush. Flowers were bunched up against the path, offering a more informal, hey-what’s-up greeting. Under my feet was a geological layer known as the Johnnie Formation: gray, green, and reddish slate. The shards clinked metallically when I stepped on them. This was the result of metamorphic hardening, Darrel Cowan told me later. Halfway up, the path flattens out and traverses an open, rolling terrain, which has the delightful name Arcane Meadows. Then you enter a pine grove, mostly juniper and piñon. I looked at the piñon cones, knowing that in the fall members of the Timbisha tribe would harvest them on the slopes below. Following an ancient practice that Pauline Esteves teaches the younger generations, they pick cones off the trees with poles, remove the nuts, and roast them. Farther up the slope are bristlecone pines, with sinewy, almost humanoid trunks. They can live for thousands of years. After four hours, I reached the summit. In a reversal of the illusion on the valley floor, Badwater seemed impossibly distant, much farther than fifteen miles off. A scrim of haze had hidden the peaks of the Sierra Nevada—there were forest fires to the south—but the panorama was staggering all the same. Ridge after ridge, basin after basin, the entire pulled-apart topography of the region came into view. “Each range here is like a warship standing on its own,” John McPhee wrote in “Basin and Range,” his great 1981 book about the geology of the American West. “It is a soundless immensity with mountains in it.” Next to the summit cairn was a beat-up old ammunition box containing a visitor’s log going back several months. In that time, around a hundred hikers had reached the top, including a college graduate who was celebrating his freedom with a cross-country trip; a mother who was hiking with her kids; and two women who were marking the anniversaries of their cancer diagnoses. I sifted through the comments: I pray that I leave life’s worries on top of this mountain and come down with a new perspective. Don’t know how much longer I’ll be able to do this, but happy I can \u0026 did today! Started up in 1985 + made it to the top today. Take good care of mother nature please, all of you. You still have her presence here in the US. It’s all one big mystery. Hope we make it down the gravel road with my Prius. Several people remarked on the paradox that Death Valley is full of life. One underscored the message with a sketch of a lizard. I thought again about the misfortune of the name. In recent years, Mt. McKinley, in Alaska, has reverted to its Native name, Denali; perhaps the same thing could eventually happen with Timbisha. The environmental historian William Cronon, in a 1995 essay entitled “The Trouble with Wilderness,” observes that national parks can have the effect of letting us off the hook: reassured by the sight of seemingly pristine nature, we go back to trampling it in our daily lives. Death Valley is, in a way, the most honest of parks: it offers no such Edenic mirage. The mining craze has left an ineradicable mark, with one escarpment after another clawed by greed. There is also no escaping the force field of the military-industrial complex. Above much of the park is a Special Use Airspace used by the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake and other Department of Defense facilities: the silence of the desert is periodically broken by the noise of jets. From Telescope Peak, it is not hard to imagine a world that has been comprehensively stripped and scoured. You wonder how much more of the planet will begin to look like Mars. “Today’s people are beginning to see a little differently,” Pauline Esteves told me. “They see climate change, which we brought on ourselves, being so greedy. They see how we’ve destroyed nature, which is good medicine for you. Maybe if they start to call this place Timbisha instead of Death Valley, it will be a step in the right direction.” ♦","description":"","keywords":"","time":1478491200,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/14/death-valley-is-alive?mbid=rss"},{"title":"The Really Small Ones","body":"By their nature, coastal towns are seldom at the center of things. The little boardwalk city of Seaside, Oregon, is in the far northwest corner of the state, four square miles that are not square, bisected by a river and flush against the ocean. In the summer months, nearly everyone there is from elsewhere; given a little sunshine, well over half a million tourists spread their towels along the town’s long shoreline. After Labor Day, though, the candy stores and kite shops close their shutters, the “VACANCY” signs blink on, and the beach, gone brown with rain, thins out to seagulls and bundled-up locals walking their dogs. Year-round, some sixty-five hundred people live in Seaside. But everything is at the center of something. Last year, I wrote an article in this magazine about the Cascadia subduction zone, a little-known fault line that cyclically produces the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in North America—shaking of magnitude 9.0 or higher, waves of a scale and destructive force analogous to the 2011 disaster in Japan. The subduction zone runs for seven hundred miles along the western coast of our continent. At its south end is Cape Mendocino, California. At its north end is Vancouver Island, Canada. In the middle is Seaside. That centrality is not just geographic. With one possible exception—the similarly unlucky town of Long Beach, Washington—no other place on the West Coast is as imperilled by the Cascadia subduction zone as Seaside. When the earthquake hits, the continent will jolt westward into the Pacific, displacing an enormous amount of ocean. All of that seawater will be forced upward into a massive liquid mountain, which will promptly collapse and rush back toward the shore. That’s the tsunami, which will flood the coastal region up to a mile and a half inland and to a depth of twenty, forty, even a hundred feet, depending on your precise location. The area that will be swamped is called the inundation zone; within it, tsunamis are essentially unsurvivable. Eighty-three per cent of Seaside’s population and eighty-nine per cent of its workforce are located inside that zone. So is its energy infrastructure, water supply, wastewater-treatment plant, hospital, police department, and fire stations. And so, during the school year, are nearly all of its children. The Seaside School District serves some fifteen hundred students, spread out across four different buildings. One of those, Seaside Heights Elementary, is, as its name suggests, on high enough ground to be relatively safe. The other three—an elementary school, a middle school, and a high school—are between five and fifteen feet above sea level. Seismologists expect that in a full-scale Cascadia earthquake, the tsunami in Seaside will be between forty-five and fifty feet high. It will make landfall roughly fifteen minutes after the earthquake begins, which means that, to have any chance of getting to safety, students and staff will need to start evacuating as soon as the shaking stops. Unfortunately, even their very first step will be, at best, extremely difficult, because none of the schools in Seaside’s inundation zone have been seismically retrofitted. According to the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, in a major earthquake, all three are likely to suffer catastrophic collapse. Those who manage to escape from whatever is left of the middle school will have to walk uphill for eight-tenths of a mile, through rubble, fires, and flooding, over a bridge that might not remain standing. Those who escape the high school will need to walk a mile in that landscape, likewise over a possibly nonexistent bridge. As for those at the grade school: they have no viable evacuation option at all. Gearhart Elementary School is sandwiched between the ocean and a wetland, through which no roads exist and none can be built, because the ground there will liquefy in an earthquake. At present, students at the school, together with everyone else in the eponymous Gearhart neighborhood, are instructed to walk to a nearby forty-foot ridge. Seismologists expect the tsunami there to be five feet higher than that, but even if it were five inches higher, that would be enough—or rather, too much. At the speed a tsunami travels, three inches of water suffices to knock over a grown man, to say nothing of a third grader. For the past nineteen years, all of this has been the chief headache and potential heartache of a man named Doug Dougherty, the longtime superintendent of the Seaside School District. Dougherty began his career in Seaside as a teacher at—and later principal of—the now-defunct Cannon Beach Elementary School. That school was situated so close to its namesake that, if you opened the windows, you could listen to the surf all day long. In 1995, as seismologists began to sound the alarm about seismic risk in the region, Dougherty became the first principal in the United States to institute tsunami evacuation drills. That seemed like a life-saving innovation (it attracted national attention, and national praise), until engineers examined the bridge along the evacuation route and determined that it would collapse in an earthquake. The only other route to high ground was almost a mile and a half long. To get to safety, everyone at the school—faculty members, five-year-olds, kids who were on crutches after breaking a leg on the playground—would need to be able to cover that distance in not much more than ten minutes. “It was really clear,” Dougherty said, “that we wouldn’t be able to have even a small chance of getting everyone out.” In 1998, Dougherty became superintendent; fifteen years later, in 2013, he finally succeeded in closing Cannon Beach Elementary School. That same year, he came up with a plan to protect the district’s other students as well, by buying land outside the inundation zone and building a new K-12 campus there, which would double as a much-needed evacuation site for the entire city. The projected cost was one hundred and twenty-eight million dollars. No national funds were available, because of a ban on federal earmarks. No state funds were available, because, although Oregon provides money to seismically retrofit schools, those inside the tsunami inundation zone aren’t eligible to apply—a strangely cruel provision that leaves the lowest and soon-to-be-wettest schools high and dry. That left the city to foot the bill on its own, which it proposed doing via a tax increase of $2.16 per thousand dollars of property value—less than the price of a latte. The bond measure went up for a vote in 2014. So reasonable was the ask, and so dire the issue, that Dougherty, together with almost everyone involved, felt confident that it would pass. It failed, by a wide margin: sixty-two per cent to thirty-eight per cent. Next week, another, more modest version of that bond measure will be back on the ballot. This time, the Weyerhaeuser timber company has agreed to donate eighty acres of land outside the tsunami inundation zone, leaving the town to cover only the cost of construction and relocation. The price of the bond has dropped to $1.35 per thousand dollars of property value. That isn’t much, but, as Dougherty knows by now, it isn’t nothing, either. Many of Seaside’s residents are service employees, working in restaurants or cleaning hotels; more than half of them live below the poverty line. As devastating as the coming natural disaster will be, it is difficult to convince people to put money toward the future when the demands of the present are so pressing. But, of course, the future has a way of becoming the present—sometimes much sooner than we expect. According to seismologists, the odds that a major Cascadia earthquake and tsunami will strike within the next fifty years are one in three. As for the odds that the bond measure will pass: this time, Dougherty is declining to speculate. Instead, having stepped down as superintendent, in June, he is using his putative retirement to fight for the measure’s passage. He has also chosen to stay in his current house, although it is in Gearhart, the area of Seaside from which it is essentially impossible to evacuate. He understands the risk involved in living there, but, he told me, he can’t bring himself to leave as long as others have no choice but to work and study there. “My wife and I have a plan that if we need to climb trees, we will climb trees,” he said. Their home sits atop the neighborhood’s forty-foot ridge; the trees buy them another sixty feet. It is true that trees fare better in earthquakes than homes and hotels and brick elementary schools. Still, as he spoke, I pictured the tsunami—not just coming in but receding, with the terrifying detritus of an entire city smashing around inside it. To be precariously balanced just above that kind of disaster: that is where Seaside finds itself right now, as it prepares to vote on its bond measure this Tuesday. Either the city will choose to knock down its schools and rebuild them somewhere safer—or, sooner or later, other forces will knock them over instead. For those who live there, for those with loved ones there, for anyone with a school-aged child and an imagination, the issue is as stark as the one at the top of the ballot: a vote for reason or for madness, for relative safety or looming catastrophe.","description":"Kathryn Schulz on the threats that the Cascadia fault line poses to the small Oregon town of Seaside, and what one leader is trying to do about it.","keywords":"","time":1478277049,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-really-small-ones?mbid=rss"},{"title":"With Health-Care Reform, Listen Carefully to Trump’s Words","body":"During the Presidential campaign, one of the consistent policy positions held by candidate Donald Trump was that he would, as his Web site puts it, “immediately deliver a full repeal” of the Affordable Care Act, more familiarly known as Obamacare, and replace it with a plan that will use “free market principles . . . that will broaden healthcare access, make healthcare more affordable and improve the quality of the care available to all Americans.” On Sunday, however, when Trump appeared on “60 Minutes,” he surprised many when he said he would keep some of Obamacare in place, particularly its guarantee of health insurance regardless of any preëxisting medical conditions. Trump’s official transition Web site doesn’t provide much clarity as to how he will deliver on this promise; the policies described there—and not just those related to health care, but also to defense, taxation, immigration—are still in the vague phase. The Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, in a giddy interview on Fox News’s “Special Report with Bret Baier,” essentially suggested that Trump would turn to Ryan’s long-standing agenda for America, especially when it comes to health care. Ryan has drafted several health-care proposals over the years, all of which have the goal of reducing the amount of money the federal government spends to cover health costs. Ryan’s plans, while much more detailed than Trump’s, are not fully formed, but both he and Trump have said they expect health-care reform to be among the first actions of the new Administration. Some Republicans have suggested that Congress could pass a law and present it to Trump on January 20, 2017, the first day of his Administration, making a repeal of Obamacare effective one or two years down the road. If that happens, it will begin a lengthy process in which congressional staff, lobbyists, advocates for patients and providers, and White House officials negotiate the technical details. The language used to discuss these changes will, often, be technical or obfuscating, following a seeming unwritten rule that health-care legislation must be drafted with the maximum number of acronyms and technical terms. So, as the discussion of what will happen to the Affordable Care Act proceeds, it’s important to focus on what the words used to discuss the reforms actually mean. When you hear “preëxisting conditions,” ask about underwriting. Trump made at least some skeptics happy when he said that he planned to keep one of the most popular provisions of Obamacare, the guarantee of coverage for all, regardless of any preëxisting conditions. This may sound easy, but it’s anything but. Obamacare not only requires coverage for those with preëxisting conditions, it also guarantees that everyone will pay the same premiums regardless of his health status. So, for example, if you have diabetes, your insurance premium won’t be higher than a person who lives in the same state and is of the same age but doesn’t have diabetes. This was one of the essential and revolutionary transformations made by Obamacare, and it is why there is a much more vibrant—if troubled—independent health-insurance marketplace for people who don’t get coverage through their jobs. Previously, in many states, insurers charged each person a risk-adjusted premium based on his or her health history. The process of evaluating the risk of patients and charging them accordingly is called underwriting, and if Trump allows underwriting, insurance will be so expensive for people with some preëxisting conditions that it will be unobtainable. Guaranteeing coverage to all but charging each person individually is, effectively, the same as refusing coverage to those with any history of cancer, chronic disease, life-altering accidents, or other health issues. Sure, you are guaranteed coverage, but it will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. When you hear “ban on underwriting,” ask about mandates. If Trump and Congress do ban individual underwriting, guaranteeing that everyone can get insurance and pay the same premium, the question is whether there’s a mechanism that requires healthy people to sign up along with the sick. New York State offers the classic example of the disaster that can unfold when insurance companies are prohibited from underwriting individuals, but individuals are free to opt out of insurance. Economists call it adverse selection. Sick people, the ones most likely to use health care, sign up first, which forces the insurance companies to raise premiums so that their health-care costs will be covered. Healthy people, especially the young, refuse to pay these high premiums and are not covered at all. Health insurance becomes wildly expensive and rare. The solution in Obamacare was the mandate, which required all citizens to have some form of insurance. Many of the challenges facing Obamacare stem from the fact that too few young and healthy people signed up for policies—even with the mandate. (The law tried to whack people with penalties if they didn’t sign up, but that didn’t work as effectively as expected.) In criticizing Obamacare, Trump has singled out the mandate as the most pernicious aspect of the law, but he hasn’t explained how, if there is no mandate, he would insure affordable coverage for people with preëxisting conditions. When you hear “vouchers,” ask how their value will be determined. Ryan’s most radical plans for reforming health care involve Medicare. Currently, Medicare provides insurance to tens of millions of people, most of them over sixty-five. Its benefits rise in rough proportion to the cost of the care they receive. Ryan proposes a system in which Medicare recipients receive vouchers—essentially, cash payments—to cover their health-care premiums. In past proposals, Ryan has suggested that the vouchers be set at specific dollar amounts that have no relationship to the cost of health care. Health-care costs have risen far faster than inflation for years (although the pace of increase slowed considerably since Obamacare was enacted). Under Ryan’s plans, people who have Medicare would have to cover a rapidly growing share of their care out of their own pockets. How the voucher amount is calculated will determine whether Medicare continues to be a program that insures that older Americans will have reliable, affordable health insurance, or if it will become an unaffordable luxury for the wealthy. When you hear “block grants,” ask how state legislatures will protect the poor. Another major transformation of health-care funding would come from Ryan’s proposal to eliminate federal grants to states and replace them with block grants. Much health coverage for the poor goes through state-administered Medicaid programs, with funding provided by the federal government. As health-care costs increase, the federal government automatically sends more money to the states. Ryan would replace this system with one in which the federal government provides a block grant that only rises with over-all inflation, not with the cost of health care, which rises faster than inflation. As health-care costs increase, each state government will be left with a difficult choice. It can redirect funding from other state functions, it can raise taxes, or it can reduce benefits for the poor. This could likely lead to wide disparities in the quality and affordability of health care for poor people in different states. If the differences are stark enough, it’s easy to imagine many poor people moving from less generous states to those offering greater coverage. As a nation, we decided with the passage of Obamacare that every citizen should get some degree of health care, regardless of past health history or lack of money. This means we need to subsidize the poor, the sick, and the risky, and the core question in any program is how big that subsidy will be. There are two simple questions to ask of any policy: How will older people, sick people, and the poor receive care under this plan? How much of the rising cost of health care will they have to cover?","description":"Adam Davidson on what to look for when Donald Trump turns his attention to reforming the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.","keywords":"","time":1479335929,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/adam-davidson/with-health-care-reform-listen-carefully-to-trumps-words?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Trump’s Conflict-of-Interest Problem","body":"“Are you planning on putting your assets in a blind trust should you become President?” the Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo asked Donald Trump during a Presidential-primary debate in South Carolina, in January. “How difficult will it be for you to disentangle yourself from your business and your money and prioritize America’s interests first?” “If I become President, I couldn’t care less about my company,” Trump answered, waving her off. “It’s peanuts.” “So you’ll put your assets in a blind trust?” Bartiromo asked again. “I would put it in a blind trust—well, I don’t know if it’s a blind trust if Ivanka, Don, and Eric run it. Is that a blind trust? I don’t know.” He looked around and shrugged. “But I would probably have my children run it with my executives, and I wouldn’t ever be involved.” The comments were startling at the time he made them, but what is even more remarkable is what has occurred since: Trump was elected President and, so far at least, has shown no sign that he understands or has ever even thought about conflict-of-interest laws, or conflicts of interest. On November 10th, two days after the election, an attorney for the Trump Organization named Michael Cohen told CNN that the President-elect intended simply to turn control of his company over to his three children from his first marriage, who would run it through a “blind trust,” a suggestion that makes little sense on its face, given that a trust is only considered “blind” if the trustees are individuals with no financial relationship with the company’s owner. The former Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush all placed their assets in blind trusts while serving as President. (Obama has all of his money in Treasury bills and index funds, investments that aren’t seen as a conflict.) In any case, the idea of Trump setting up an impossible-sounding blind trust with his children dissolved the following day, when he announced that three of his children would serve on the executive committee of his Presidential transition team, helping him to fill jobs in his government. Trump and his offspring had already been treating the Presidential campaign like a world-spanning, high-stakes branding opportunity for Trump-related businesses. The Trump campaign directed millions of dollars in campaign expenses to Trump-related ventures: rent was paid to Trump Tower, where the campaign headquarters was located; events were held at Trump golf courses and other properties; Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club was paid for lodging, facilities, and catering, according to Politico. Trump’s daughter Ivanka used campaign appearances as an opportunity to advertise clothing from her own fashion line. The perception of Trump as a talented businessman drove a large part of his appeal to voters who want a piece of his gilded capitalism for themselves. It’s hard to imagine that he’ll be willing to let that all go and dedicate himself to public service. (Trump himself reportedly donated upwards of fifty million dollars to the campaign.) It turns out that there is no legal requirement that a President divest himself or herself of private business interests or investments while in office. Nor is there a requirement that he place investments or companies he controls in a blind trust, by which an independent third party manages the assets while he serves in government. There are federal ethics rules that prohibit members of Congress and Cabinet members from accepting gifts from anyone who has business before their agency, as well as requiring that they recuse themselves from governmental affairs that affect their financial interests. The roles of President and Vice-President were exempted from those rules because it was believed that the office of the President was so vast in its responsibilities that it would be virtually impossible to police. As Kenneth Gross, a partner at Skadden Arps, and a former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission, notes, it was also assumed that no President would attempt to run the government and a business simultaneously. The authors of the Constitution, however, did have insight into the potential abuse of the office of President, and they inserted something called the Emoluments Clause into Section 9 of Article I. It states, in part, that “no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.” This clause, Gross said, basically means that anything of significant value from a foreign government or a company controlled by one that accrues to the Trump Organization while Trump owns it could provide the seed of an investigation and impeachment. Trump listed five hundred and sixty-four line items on his financial-disclosure form; appearing under “Filer’s Positions Held Outside United States Government” are the names DT Marks Qatar LLC, DT Marks Dubai LLC, THC Services Shenzhen LLC, and many other opaque, foreign-sounding entities. “This is not something esoteric. This is an area that the incoming President must address, along with his other conflicts,” Gross, who advised Michael Bloomberg on the management of his assets while he was the Mayor of New York City, said. (I formerly worked at Bloomberg L.P.) “This is a very unique problem for him—we don’t have a very good picture of his financial situation, we really don’t know what he owns, we don’t know all his entanglements.” Gross noted that, in some sense, it’s impossible to separate Trump from his assets. “One of the problems that Trump has is he already knows what properties he already owns. It does no good in terms of blinding assets he already owns, and it does no good if his children are running it, in resolving the conflict, because his self-interests are co-existent with his children’s interests,” Gross said. In an interview on Sunday with Jake Tapper, on CNN, Rudy Giuliani argued that taking the family businesses away from Trump’s children and giving them to a third party would “be putting them out of work.” The best conflict-of-interest measure he could envision was a document attesting that President Trump would not be involved in the running of his companies. If there is a precedent, it might be found in New York State government, where legislators serve part-time and are allowed to maintain outside businesses, which range from coffee shops to their own law firms. Disclosure requirements are intended to reveal potential conflicts, but there are no limitations on the amount of income legislators can bring in from outside work. It didn’t shock anyone when Sheldon Silver, the former speaker of the State Assembly, and Dean Skelos, the former Senate Majority Leader, were convicted, last year, of corruption charges. In Silver’s case, the crime was referring cases from companies with business before the state to law firms that paid him bonuses and referral fees; Skelos was accused of referring business to help his son. (Both cases are on appeal.) “It’s a tremendous problem when it’s completely obvious how someone seeking governmental action from the United States can provide substantial benefit to its chief executive,” Arlo Devlin-Brown, a partner at Covington and Burling, who oversaw the Silver and Skelos prosecutions as the chief of the public-corruption unit at the Manhattan U.S. Attorney’s Office, said. A foreign or domestic company could choose to license the Trump name for a real-estate development or for marketing a line of Trump edible-fruit arrangements, to take one simple example; the company would know that it was benefitting the President no matter who was managing the Trump Organization, and President Trump would know it, too. “The problem here is the appearance of impropriety—nearly every single company is trying to get something from the executive branch,” Devlin-Brown said. When I asked Ken Gross, of Skadden, if he knew of any other examples of world leaders attempting to continue earning enormous profits from their private companies while they were in office, he paused. “There was a look at Silvio Berlusconi when I was representing Mike, but I think he ended up going to jail, if I’m not mistaken,” Gross said (He was nearly right: Berlusconi was convicted of various charges, but did community service.) “I think the private businesses and the government functions in Italy maybe are exactly what we should be worried about. And, obviously, there are non-democracies where the people in charge don’t get the concept of conflict of interest.”","description":"Sheelah Kolhatkar on the many conflicts of interest that will face Donald Trump during his Presidency, and why he is unlikely to address them adequately.","keywords":"","time":1479167298,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-conflict-of-interest-problem?mbid=rss"},{"title":"What the Markets Can, and Can’t, Tell Us About a Trump Presidency","body":"There was a moment on Tuesday night when it seemed as if the world economy might collapse along with Hillary Clinton’s chances of becoming President. Stock futures—a bet on how the stock market would react when it opened on Wednesday morning—fell everywhere. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its largest rise in months on Monday, when investors seemed to believe a Clinton victory was all but guaranteed. Then, on Tuesday night, Dow futures predicted a fall of more than eight hundred points, which would be the largest single-day collapse on record. The S\u0026P 500 futures fell five per cent, a fall so precipitous that it triggered a freeze in trading. Markets in Asia and Europe were already open or soon would be when the world learned that Donald J. Trump had certainly been elected, and they fell straight down. Bloomberg News published a chart showing a rare event: every market, everywhere, collapsing as one. Currencies, too, dropped. Most notably, the Mexican peso fell more than ten per cent, an unimaginable drop in a single day. Every prognosticator, and the markets themselves, had been expecting one of the worst days of trading in history in the event of a Trump victory. It seemed reasonable to expect that Wednesday would bring the instantaneous disappearance of trillions of dollars of value worldwide, as investors recalibrated their expectations downward. But if the election has taught us anything, it is to question expectations. When the markets opened in New York, there was no panicked selling, and by noon stock prices had risen by more than one per cent. Politico reported that Treasury and Federal Reserve officials were monitoring the situation closely, prepared to take extraordinary action, if needed, to save the U.S. economy from free fall. They had no need to take any action. What do we make of this? There were specific subplots. Pharmaceutical companies and private prisons saw their values rise, presumably rooted in a belief that President Trump will abandon efforts to rein them in. Gun stocks fell—a sign that Americans no longer fear a gun-control advocate in the White House. But the over-all movement of the markets was not rooted in specifics. In times of surprising, confusing news, markets quickly become solipsistic: trading not on what each trader believes will happen in the real world but on what each trader guesses all the other traders are thinking. Or, as John Maynard Keynes wrote, “We devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practice the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.” Figuring out what the average trader thinks the average trader thinks can take a bit of time and trial and error. Thus huge swings downward and upward are often not signs of a changing assessment of the world so much as feints this way and that until everyone stops moving for a moment. This doesn’t mean there isn’t information in the steady rise of stock values throughout the day. The lack of a sustained collapsed or a stampede toward gold—which is where people run in times of fear—and the relative stability of Treasury bonds suggested there was no panic about the long-term viability of the U.S. economy. Global investors, at least for now, seem persuaded that we don’t face a sudden, sharp economic disaster. That is where the good news ends. The markets are bad at measuring longer-term threats. At base, our way of life is rooted in a series of explicit and implicit commitments that the United States has made with much of the world since 1946. We will maintain our currency and responsibly pay our debts so that, instead of gold, the world can have the dollar as a safe base upon which all other economic activity can take place. We will fund and manage global institutions that, while far from perfect, provide some sense of order and fairness to global business. These include the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization. We will use our Navy to make the seas safe for commerce and our military might to insure that the world’s developed nations see their interests and ours as intertwined. Trump has attacked every one of these foundations. How much should you pay for Apple stock, say, if we have to worry about the dollar plummeting in value and the President declaring a trade war on China, which is both Apple’s chief supplier and its fastest-growing market? There is no financial model, right now, for that many levels of structural uncertainty. Markets are designed to make relatively minor adjustments on a fundamentally sound base. They never perform well when the base itself is under assault, as it was during the financial crisis of 2008. There was a lot of talk, leading up to that crisis, about the various worries in the global economy—subprime lending, China’s huge cash surplus, overleveraged banks. But it took years for most investors to understand fully that these weren’t normal problems in a functioning market. When they finally understood that the market had ceased being normal and couldn’t function, it was no longer possible to deal with it in the normal fashion of selling lousy stuff and moving money to assets that had more promise. The markets were themselves frozen and incapable of responding, which made the already toxic assets even more dangerous. Donald Trump’s proposed policies are, in this technical sense, toxic. Of course we don’t know yet how his confused policy proposals will be presented to Congress or whether a Republican Congress will see itself as a check on his worst impulses or a booster of them. But what he said on the campaign trail suggests that there could be many unintended economic consequences (and some terrifying intended ones). The repeal of Obamacare, alone, would force many people to forgo their riskier, entrepreneurial ambitions for the safety of a job with a health plan. Curtailing immigration will redirect the world’s most ambitious citizens elsewhere. A trade war with Mexico and China would be damaging in ways that are hard to fathom or measure. Trump’s tax plan will turn America’s serious but manageable debt burden into a crisis weighing on future generations. Economists distinguish between the words “uncertainty” and “risk” carefully. To them, risk is measurable, knowable, discussable. You and I might have different views of the chance of, say, General Motors doing better next year, but we come to our different understandings using similar tools, similar vocabulary. Uncertainty refers to that which can’t be measured or defined, the darkness about which we know nothing. We are, once again, in a period of deep uncertainty. The future is, literally, inconceivable to us now.

A hundred and sixty-one thousand new jobs were created in October, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9 per cent, and wages grew faster than at any point since the financial crisis. Combined with last week’s report of strong G.D.P. growth, this is evidence that our economy is healthy and growing—and that growth is being reasonably widely shared. While this doesn’t mean that America’s growth is as robust as we might wish, or that we don’t face deep challenges, these numbers are incompatible with a view that America is in a profound economic crisis. Yet many people believe it is. This discordance between economic data and political rhetoric is familiar, or should be. Every four years, Republicans argue that they, alone, can help the economy grow, while Democrats argue that they will make sure that economic growth doesn’t just help the rich. If either argument were true, we might expect to see growth and inequality rise and fall in four- or eight-year cycles. The data we have, though, contradict this basic story. Growth is actually notably higher during Democratic Administrations. The graph of economic performance since the Second World War shows growth averaging 4.33 per cent a year under Democratic Presidencies, while growing at 2.54 per cent under Republican ones. There was a chance that this trend would break this term, because the economy has slowed down quite a bit and we do, of course, have a Democratic President. But the recent good economic news suggests that the pattern will hold for President Obama’s second term. Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, two economists at Princeton, published an influential study of the relationship between a President’s party and economic growth. They concluded that a lot about the economy is beyond the President’s control, but, on balance, as Blinder told me, the economy grows faster under Democrats because “Democrats have better policies.” (Blinder, who served on President Bill Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, and Watson are both Democrats). Republican economists caution against taking this data as proof that their party is lousy at economic policy. Kevin Hassett, of the American Enterprise Institute, who advised every Republican Presidential candidate between 2000 and 2012, sees the cause and effect differently: American voters choose Democrats when they believe the economy is about to take off, because they want the government to spend a lot of money; then, when Democrats damage the economy and things turn south, voters choose Republicans to sort out the mess. The data doesn’t seem to conform to this description, because the economy does quite well during the second terms of Democratic Presidents, but there are nonetheless reasons to question Blinder’s reading of the data, too. For one thing, Presidents have to deal with Congress, which is not always so willing to pass laws that support a President’s policies. But, more important, the effects of many economic policies are not felt for years, even decades or centuries. Glenn Hubbard, who served as the chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush and to Mitt Romney’s Presidential campaign, cautioned me to take an even longer view of the impact of good policies. “I don’t know what G.D.P. growth was during the Washington and Lincoln Administrations, but the institutional developments in those terms had large and long-lasting effects.” Hubbard’s point is that the difference between economic performance during Democratic and Republican Administrations is miniscule when compared to the difference between the economy of the U.S. and that of much of the rest of the world. The U.S., along with a handful of European nations, has had solid, fairly consistent economic growth for more than two centuries (with, of course, some notable dark times), and for most of that period economic growth has benefitted poor and rich alike. That growth is best understood by pulling the focus far back from the narrow lens of one election. What matters most are those things that endure for decades and centuries: democracy, rule of law, a civilian-led military, political stability, and freedom of speech and movement. America is a rich country not because of what the Democrats or the Republicans did separately. It is successful because of those things that the parties share, national values and institutions. Institutions are significant to economists, who have come to see that countries become prosperous not because they have bounteous natural resources or an educated population or the most advanced technology but because they have good institutions. Crucially, formal structures are supported by informal, often unstated, social agreements. A nation not only needs courts; its people need to believe that those courts can be fair. An army needs to be legally under civil command, but, just as important, its generals, as well as its privates, must obey that authority. Over most of history, a small élite confiscated wealth from the poor. Subsistence farmers lived under rules designed to tax them so that the rulers could live in palaces and pay for soldiers to maintain their power. Every now and then, though, a system appeared in which leaders were forced to accommodate the needs of at least some of their citizens. This happened in ancient Athens, the Roman Republic, Venice during the Middle Ages, England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and, later, the U.S. and much of continental Europe. The societies with the most robust systems for forcing the powerful to accommodate some of the needs of the powerless became wealthier and more peaceful. Good rules persuaded people with ambition and ideas to invest in the future, trusting that stability and rule of law would protect them. Most nations without institutions to check the worst impulses of the rich and powerful stay stuck in poverty and dysfunction. (A few, such as the Soviet Union and Spain in the sixteenth century, were able to get rich for a while but eventually collapsed). This explains why America’s quadrennial fights over tax rates and government spending are meaningful in the short term and to many individuals, but, over a longer arc, it’s the institutions we’ve built and respect that allow for a trajectory of growth. This year’s Presidential election has alarmed economists for several reasons. No economist, save one, supports Donald J. Trump’s stated economic plans, but an even larger concern is that, were he elected, Trump would attack the very institutions that have provided our economic stability. In his campaign, Trump has shown outright contempt for courts, free speech, international treaties, and many other pillars of the American way of life. There is little reason to think that, if granted the Presidency, Trump would soften his stand. To calibrate where to place the significance of what is at stake in Tuesday’s vote, I called two economists, Daron Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Jim Robinson, of the University of Chicago. They have published a series of influential academic studies comparing the successes and failures of different sorts of economic institutions, as well as a popular account of their ideas, “Why Nations Fail.” I suppose I was hoping to hear that this election is a mere blip and that American institutions can easily withstand Trump’s assault on their formal and informal rules. Acemoglu told me that he has been thinking lately about ancient Rome, and, while he acknowledged that such a comparison is “usually spurious,” he has been unable to shake off the story of how Rome stopped being a quasi-democratic republic and became a dictatorship. Specifically, he sees parallels between the potential to elect Trump and a moment, in 81 B.C.E., when Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, a general, marched into Rome and declared himself dictator. There are more differences between Sulla and Trump, Rome and the U.S., than there are similarities, but that doesn’t discredit the resemblances. Sulla, a wealthy and powerful élitist, was able to take advantage of anger among the less privileged to suggest that existing societal rules were keeping Rome from reclaiming its greatness. He steadily eroded custom, by, for example, encouraging soldiers to pledge allegiance to him rather than to the state, and to suggest that the Senate was sclerotic and corrupt. His attacks on the institutions seemed like minor tweaks at first, but, over time, Rome sank into autocracy. Acemoglu’s co-author, Robinson, has been thinking of a more recent example: Argentina in 1943. Juan Perón, supported by the populace, consolidated power over a wealthy country with a perfectly functional, if far from perfect, government, and proceeded to destroy its institutions, starting with the Supreme Court. Robinson said that it’s easy to imagine a President Trump refusing to heed our own highest court, which, as President Andrew Jackson observed, has no way, other than respect of institutions, to enforce its decisions. No one knows what Trump would do as President, but, based on his statements on the campaign trail, it’s possible to imagine a nation where people have less confidence in the courts, the military, and their rights to free speech and assembly. When this happens, history tells us, people stop dreaming about what they could have if they invest in education, new businesses, and new ideas. They focus, instead, on taking from others and holding tightly to what they’ve already amassed. Those societies, without the institutions that protect us from our worst impulses, become poorer, uglier, more violent. That is how nations fail.","description":"Adam Davidson on America’s improving economy, and how stability and democracy are threatened by Donald Trump’s attacks on national values and institutions.","keywords":"","time":1478367013,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/more-jobs-a-strong-economy-and-a-threat-to-institutions?mbid=rss"},{"title":"How Airbnb Makes It Hard to Sue for Discrimination","body":"In March of 2015, Gregory Selden, a twenty-five-year-old black man from Virginia, was planning a trip to Philadelphia. He’d heard it could be cheaper to stay at someone’s house, through Airbnb, than to rent a hotel, so he created an Airbnb profile, with a photo and some basic details about himself, and sent an inquiry to a host whose place looked appealing. The host quickly wrote back: the accommodation was already taken for those dates. But Selden thought there was something strange about the exchange—for one thing, the Airbnb site described the place as available—so he decided to conduct an experiment. He created two fake Airbnb profiles, for white people named “Jessie” and “Todd,” and put in requests for accommodations at the same property over the same dates. Again, a reply arrived right away, but this time they were different: Jessie and Todd were welcome. Selden alleged all this in a lawsuit, filed in May in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing Airbnb of facilitating racial discrimination. Selden sought to make his case a class action. He figured that other Airbnb users must have had similar experiences, and he had good reason to think so. The previous December, a Harvard working paper had found that Airbnb users with stereotypically black names are likelier to have accommodation requests rejected than those with white-sounding names. (The authors of the paper, like Selden, used fake profiles.) More recently, people began venting their discrimination stories online with the hashtag #AirbnbWhileBlack. But two months after Selden filed suit, Airbnb made an argument that would have confounded most non-lawyers. It had nothing to do with whether Airbnb had been involved in discrimination. Instead, Airbnb pointed out that, in the fine print of its seventeen-page terms of service—which every Airbnb user, including Selden, had to accept before signing up for the service—was a clause barring customers from either bringing a civil suit against Airbnb that could lead to a jury trial or filing a class action against it; instead, they have to go through a private arbitration process outside of the legal system, overseen by a paid arbitrator who acts as a kind of extralegal judge. Airbnb wanted the court to force Selden into arbitration. On Tuesday, Judge Christopher R. Cooper agreed to do so. Arbitration clauses aren’t well understood outside of the legal world, but they’ve become increasingly common, including in Silicon Valley, with companies describing arbitration as faster, cheaper, and easier than going to court. Netflix and Amazon, among others, embed these clauses into their terms of service. But the benefits of arbitration clauses tend to skew toward the businesses that require them—not to the consumers. Last fall, the Times investigated the practice in a three-part series, calling arbitration “a far-reaching power play orchestrated by American corporations” that makes it much more difficult for consumers to challenge companies for improper practices. Because the people hired to carry out arbitration sessions often work for the same companies over and over, the arbitrators have an incentive to bias their decisions toward the companies and against individuals. (Companies apply these clauses to employees, too, often enough that the subject turned up as a plot point in an episode of “Silicon Valley.”) One federal judge, William G. Young, told the Times, “Ominously, business has a good chance of opting out of the legal system altogether and misbehaving without reproach.” Often arbitration clauses are invoked in cases where consumers feel they have been financially slighted—seeing charges on their phone bills for services they never wanted, for instance—but the Times investigation found arbitrations used in more serious cases of medical malpractice, theft, hate crimes, and discrimination. The Airbnb situation highlights how far the practice extends. In light of all the negative attention around claims of racial bias, Airbnb recently created a stronger, more detailed anti-discrimination policy for “hosts”—the people who rent out their places on the site—and created a system to investigate claims of discrimination. “We have launched an aggressive effort to ensure our platform is fair for everyone and we will continue to work as hard as we know how to fight bias,” a spokesman for Airbnb, Nick Papas, wrote Tuesday in a statement sent to journalists. Yet Airbnb maintains that arbitration remains the best way to resolve disputes—including charges of discrimination—and has benefits for the disputing parties. In most cases, Airbnb pays its users’ arbitration fees and conducts hearings wherever the user lives. On Wednesday, when I e-mailed Papas about criticism of arbitration, he replied, “Our policies are similar to most companies and we’ve found that arbitration is an effective way to resolve many issues.” Then Papas made another striking point: that “guests also retain the ability to take action against hosts.” In other words, Airbnb’s customers can sue homeowners for discrimination, even while they’re barred from suing Airbnb itself. Most corporate spokesmen wouldn’t make a point of stressing that customers should feel free to sue the company’s employees even if they can’t sue the company itself. But at businesses like Airbnb, which facilitate transactions between customers and those who provide a service—ride-sharing services like Uber are another example—the service providers aren’t employees at all. Selden himself, not surprisingly, disagrees with the judge’s perspective and with Airbnb’s position. On Tuesday, his lawyer, Ikechukwu Emejuru, wrote in a statement that Selden was “very disappointed” and would appeal the judge’s decision. He added, “By placing Mr. Selden’s claims into arbitration, a consumer’s constitutional right to a jury trial and access to the courts of law continues to be whittled down gradually but surely.” Judge Cooper, for his part, is well versed in the controversy surrounding arbitration—it’s just that he doesn’t believe his court is the right venue for resolving it. “No matter one’s opinion of the widespread and controversial practice of requiring consumers to relinquish their fundamental right to a jury trial—and to forgo class actions—as a condition of simply participating in today’s digital economy, the applicable law is clear,” he wrote. Arbitration provisions in contracts are enforceable, including in discrimination cases. “While that result might seem inequitable to some, this Court is not the proper forum for policy objections to mandatory arbitration clauses in online adhesion contracts,” Cooper added. “Such objections should be taken up with the appropriate regulators or with Congress.” In fact, the objections are already being taken up. In April of 2015—a month after Selden’s bad Airbnb experience—Senator Al Franken, of Minnesota, and Congressman Hank Johnson, of Georgia, both Democrats, introduced a bill, the Arbitration Fairness Act, that would get rid of mandatory-arbitration clauses for consumers and employees. A vote could come as early as this year. The lawyers at Airbnb and throughout the corporate world are surely paying close attention.","description":"Vauhini Vara writes about allegations of racial discrimination by Airbnb host and why the company’s arbitration clause makes legal redress difficult.","keywords":"","time":1478197851,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/how-airbnb-makes-it-hard-to-sue-for-discrimination?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Quail, the Quieter Back-Yard Egg Option","body":"On a hot Saturday morning in the waning days of summer, I joined a handful of people for a participatory quail slaughter at Pettibone Urban Game, a three-quarter-acre farm in Clinton Township, a neighborhood of Columbus, Ohio. “Would you like to scald or would you like to take the skin off?” our instructor, Jerah Pettibone, asked me. I was unprepared for this question, distracted by the immediate task before me, which was to decapitate a quail by snipping its tiny neck with shiny, sharp kitchen shears. After making the fatal cut, I dropped the headless body into a bucket lined with a plastic grocery bag. Later, I decided against scalding, and peeled off the skin in feathery strips. Pettibone began organizing quail culls as a way to connect her customers—a small group of local restaurant chefs and foodies—to the cycle of her farm’s quail production. Death, she told me, “is a connection to food I don’t want to forget about.” Pettibone, who works as a substitute teacher, started raising quail three years ago, and opened Pettibone Urban Game in early 2015, on a quiet residential street, where she bought two adjoining homes with oversized lots that she jokingly refers to as “my compound.” She sells quail eggs on the honor system from her unlocked front porch. Inside a detached garage, there’s a mobile poultry-slaughter unit, which she rents to customers, and a small-scale hatchery: dozens of tiny quail scurry under bright lights on a bed of pine shavings. Chickens may have evolved into the mascot of the local foodie movement, ushering in an era of loosened zoning in many big cities, but the proliferation of chicken coops in residential areas has also resulted in a backlash against back-yard chickens: neighbors suing neighbors, codes limiting chicken flocks to four birds, and even crackdowns on residents, some of whom have been forced to get rid of their chickens entirely. Many municipalities still limit or outlaw back-yard poultry. But few have anything on the books against quail, which are sometimes licensed as wildlife. For example, Pettibone maintains a license with the Ohio Department of Natural Resources; the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission offers a fifty-dollar license for residents who want to raise game birds. In this regulatory gap, a largely unnoticed quail movement has begun. My husband and I found ourselves slaughtering these tiny birds thanks to a friend who moved out of state and couldn’t take her quail with her. The solitary bird arrived with a cage and everything that avian livestock needs: dried mealworms, woods shavings, feed, and a soap bottle retrofitted with a metal water nozzle. We live in a nineteen-fifties ranch in an inner-ring suburb, and we cleared a space near the shed and compost pile on our quarter-acre lot. We decided that the bird needed company, so we made our first visit to Pettibone’s farm a few days later and paid five dollars each for two three-week-old quail. In our second week of quail ownership, my husband came in from the back yard with the news that Chicken Little, the runt, was dead, his head half-eaten. We discussed culprits—opossum, raccoons, skunk, turkey vultures, a red-tailed hawk—but when we called Pettibone she suggested another possibility: another quail. Quail are just jerks sometimes, turning into cannibals if they get overheated or are not fed enough protein. Pecking order isn’t an idiom for no reason. We adjusted the protein in our feed, and things improved. On a good day, our tiny flock drops about three eggs, and one day we even got four. We’ve mostly stopped buying chicken eggs. Quail eggs have fewer calories (only fourteen, compared to seventy-eight per chicken egg), and with their higher protein ratio two or three can make for a surprisingly hearty breakfast. We connect with other back-yard quail owners on the Facebook group Backyard Quail, which has nearly thirty-seven hundred members, where owners sometimes relate their quail gore: “One of the other females went on a murder spree. Tried to peck the males eye out.” In her book, “The Coturnix Revolution,” Alexandra Douglas makes a convincing case for quail’s superiority over chickens: they are less expensive, take up less space, and convert feed into edible protein more efficiently. Not only is a quail cage quieter than a coop of squawking chickens, it can be small; a square foot is plenty of room for a single quail. Douglas operates a farm called Stellar Gamebirds, Poultry, and Waterfowl, and one of her fastest-growing lines is quail hatching eggs, which she packs and ships overnight to customers nationwide. Last year, she filled five hundred orders from hobbyists and back-yard farmers. Quail are prolific egg producers. A healthy quail that is fed and cared for properly might lay as many as three hundred eggs a year. It’s impossible to know, however, how many quail eggs are produced; the market is so small that the U.S.D.A. ignores quail-egg production altogether. Commercially raised quail and quail eggs were not even available in the United States until about forty years ago. Even today, there are only four large-scale commercial quail farms. Manchester Farms, the first quail farm in the U.S., was opened by Bill and Janet Odom outside Columbia, South Carolina, in the early nineteen-seventies. Bill Odom was the flock manager for the Campbell Soup Company, supervising chicken farmers in South Carolina, and started raising quail in his back yard to train his hunting dogs. His daughter, Brittney Miller, now owns and operates the four-hundred-and-fifty-acre operation, which produces about four million quail a year and logs sales of ten million dollars. It serves both the high and low end of the market; white-tablecloth restaurants to catfish shacks, fried-chicken houses, and barbecue joints. In a bid to take quail mainstream and compete directly against chicken, Miller distributes in mainstream grocers, including Kroger, Piggly Wiggly, and Publix, and has doubled the company’s distribution footprint to four thousand stores. International Quail, opened in 1983 in Greensboro, Georgia, sells sixteen million quail a year, mainly through specialty grocers serving Asian and Hispanic shoppers. “Country boys in the South would be our third-biggest market,” Arnold Cardarelli, Jr., the marketing director at the company, told me. Since joining International Quail, in 1997, Cardarelli has run countless in-store tastings and consumer surveys trying to crack the mainstream market. Taste isn’t the problem, he said; it’s the tiny bones of the bird. The day we returned home from Pettibone’s, we carried a Ziploc bag full of ice and four quail. I had no appetite, and we didn’t cook the birds right away. The next day, preparing Sunday’s dinner, I placed the dressed quail in a marinade of buttermilk and hot sauce. Each time I opened the fridge, I saw the tiny appendages sunk in white. I felt duty-bound to cook them well. I seared them in a smoking cast-iron skillet, smeared in butter and olive oil. The slightly sweet fragrance of game filled the kitchen. Lifting the birds out with tongs, I plated them with roasted sweet potatoes. Our ten-year-old son ate his corn, but didn’t touch the quail. We heated up leftover pizza for him, and my husband and I stared across the table in obligation, knowing that we had to eat this offering between the two of us. It didn’t taste like chicken. It had a sweet, almost almond-like flavor I couldn’t quite name. Later, when I talked to Cardarelli, he called it “meat with a personality.” This feels like an adequate description, if not an appetizing one.","description":"Mya Frazier on a new trend: back-yard quail, which are quieter and require less space than chickens.","keywords":"","time":1478170837,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/quail-the-quieter-back-yard-egg-option?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Why Vine Was a Bad Match for Twitter","body":"On Sunday, October 23rd, Michael Pachter and a friend took out the boat they jointly own, a Boston Whaler, on the Pacific Ocean, to watch the final day of the Breitling Huntington Beach Airshow. Like most air shows, it promised to entertain spectators with the sight of gaudily painted fighter jets performing impossible stunts in close formation. After the show, as Pachter was motoring the eight miles back to Long Beach, four F-16s—part of the United States Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron, known as the Thunderbirds, which had headlined the show—rocketed past, flying low overhead on their way back to Nevada’s Nellis Air Force Base. They flew past “literally a hundred yards away—so loud it was earth-shattering,” Pachter said. His immediate impulse was to pull out his phone and record a video of their booming flight. He promptly uploaded the video to Twitter. It was the first video he had ever tweeted. It struck him only later that what he had not done was open Vine, the mobile app for Twitter’s social video-sharing service of the same name, to record the footage. It’s true that Pachter, who is sixty years old, is not in the target demographic for Vine. But he does follow Twitter as a financial analyst for Wedbush Securities, and his little revelation drove home the point that Vine had become, in some sense, obsolete. For some time now, Twitter has allowed users to post ordinary smartphone videos, and it could hardly be easier to do. “You’d have to be a technological idiot not to be able to figure out how to do it,” Pachter told me. When Twitter acquired Vine, in 2012, for thirty million dollars, there was no Periscope, Twitter video, or Facebook Live—there was no easy way to broadcast video. And, as Mike Isaac pointed out in the Times, its six-second limit was developed when mobile video was new and people worried about running up the cost of their phones’ data plans. But now video is everywhere on social media. Vine has become superfluous, and Pachter was not surprised to learn that Twitter plans to shut it down in the months to come. The news, announced last Thursday, the same day the social network reported dismal third-quarter earnings, was greeted, on Twitter, with the hashtag #RIPVine and a cavalcade of people’s favorite Vines—clips of endlessly repeating pratfalls, reality-TV-show bloopers, awkward singing and dancing, and, in at least one case, a potato hanging from the whirling blade of a ceiling fan. It was an instance of mass nostalgia, the sharing of bittersweet artifacts from the very recent past. In a blog post announcing the shutdown, Twitter prepared to milk the mood for all it was worth. “Nothing is happening to the apps, website, or your Vines today,” the post read. “We value you, your Vines, and are going to do this the right way. . . . We’ll be keeping the website online because we think it’s important to still be able to watch all the incredible Vines that have been made.” What is incredible to me is that so many people ever used the app at all. Six seconds is too short for a speech or an instructional video but the perfect length, as it turned out, for a vast array of inanity—much of which, like the spinning potato, would never have existed had there not also existed a means for widely sharing it. Vine creators, who had no way of being compensated until June of this year, did it purely “for the lulz”—and, of course, in the hope that their Vine fame might transmogrify, as it did for a lucky few, into real celebrity. It takes Pachter, a man twice my age, to remind me how innovative Vine was when it débuted. In January, 2013, no other mobile app was offering short-form streaming video. Now, like most millennials awash in Instagram videos, Snapchat, and Facebook Live, I take the format for granted. But whereas National Geographic photographers use Instagram, and the World Economic Forum broadcasts interviews on Facebook, Vine has always been for teen-agers. They are its demographic, as Hannah Donovan, Vine’s general manager, told Variety in June. Vine, she said, is a place “where trends are happening, where memes are exploding.” Teen-agers grow up fast, but Vine didn’t. It featured comedy galore, but the witty, wordy comedy of Woody Allen or Whit Stillman it was not. “At the end of the day,” Donovan said, “Vine is not a tool. It’s a toy.” Vine’s obsolescence is the least of Twitter’s problems. The company reported a net loss of a hundred and three million dollars for the third quarter and announced it would lay off nine per cent of its workforce, some three hundred and fifty people. It has been shopping for a buyer, but recently two high-profile suitors, Salesforce and Disney, spurned it—the latter, it is widely believed, due to Twitter’s reputation as a place where trolls can harass their victims with impunity. Twitter’s revenue for the quarter was six hundred and sixteen million dollars—an increase of eight per cent over the same period last year, but peanuts compared to Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s company, which will report its third-quarter earnings next week, earned $6.24 billion of ad revenue in the second quarter, and Pachter expects the company’s ad revenue for the period that ended September 30th to be just under seven billion dollars. To put this in perspective, he says, “Facebook is growing by a Twitter every quarter.” Twitter’s platform remains the rare corporate product that feels like a public good. But its business model is “dicey,” as Curt Nickisch, of the Harvard Business Review, said in a radio interview recently. “It’s not working, and so it seems like what the company has to do is figure out how to make it work before people will step up and buy [it].” While Twitter was popular from the get-go with “influencers”—celebrities, business leaders, and gurus of various sorts who want to reach a mass audience—it is relatively bad at attracting ordinary users, who “mainly want to interact with their friends,” Nickisch said. Both he and Pachter identified this as a major obstacle to the company’s long-term success. In some sense, Vine was always a strange bedfellow for Twitter. Despite its hundred-and-forty-character limit and the recent explosion of video on the site, Twitter is still primarily a medium of words. On Twitter, I can absorb Times correspondent Rukmini Callimachi’s insights about ISIS, discuss literature and ideas with intelligent strangers, debate new scientific breakthroughs. Vine’s mass adoption and use for purposes alternately ridiculous and mundane struck me as a sign that we’re regressing from what we have been since Gutenberg—that is, people of the Book, to people of the Picture, almost pre-literate in our tastes and entertainments. Vine’s demise, however, does not signal the renewed primacy of words. “Video is quickly becoming the future of communication,” as Donovan remarked, and social media today bears ample witness to the truth of her statement, like it or not. Vine has more than two hundred million users—it is, in other words, incredibly popular. It failed because its popularity couldn’t be sufficiently monetized. No one was ever going to sit through a fifteen-second ad in order to watch a six-second Vine. By the time people began posting all those video loops in memoriam on Thursday, the medium already seemed quaint, outdated. As Brandon Stosuy, the editor-in-chief of the Creative Independent, a Web publication backed by Kickstarter, put it, “My kids will grow up not knowing what Vine was.” There is some solace in this. While early adopters of new technology have traditionally lorded it over the rest of us, secure in the knowledge that they know something we don’t, there are now times when these self-appointed ambassadors of the future—devotees of Vine, of Google Glass—wind up looking foolish. At the present burning pace of technological change, ignoring something new and popular until it withers and dies can be the most forward-looking move of all.","description":"Brian Patrick Eha on how the video platform Vine outlived its usefulness and was always poorly matched with Twitter, which is primarily a medium of words.","keywords":"","time":1478021107,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/why-vine-was-a-bad-match-for-twitter?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Peter Thiel’s Oddly Conventional Defense of Trump","body":"Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire investor, seemed out of place, diminished, when he walked up to a podium at the National Press Club on Monday. Thiel has made a fortune and cultivated a public persona based on his confident predictions about technologies that most of us barely understand. His mode of talking, in the past, could be called utopian/dystopian Manicheanism. He has described a marvellous world that could be—space colonies and abundance fuelled by biotech, cheap energy, and brilliant robots—and then explained why our risk-averse culture and stifling, confiscatory government prevent us from achieving what should be ours. At this most recent speech, though, he spoke about a topic we know all too well: Donald Trump. The core of Thiel’s message came in a line that seemed designed to generate laughs. “No one would suggest that Donald Trump is a humble man,” Thiel said. “But the big things he’s right about amount to a much-needed dose of humility in our politics.” Suggesting humility as Trump’s true strength is essential Thiel: provocative, surprising, and based on the idea that he sees something in plain sight that the rest of us have missed. Thiel was one of the few successful businesspeople to endorse Trump at the Republican National Convention this summer and, more recently, he pledged $1.25 million to support his campaign. While this is a trivial amount to Thiel, personally, and would be unremarkable in a normal Presidential campaign, it is among the largest single gifts in support of Trump (most of the money was given to a super PAC that backs Trump) and generated enormous anger among Thiel’s peers. After hearing calls to have Thiel kicked off the board of directors of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg wrote a note to staff defending him. “There are many reasons a person might support Trump that do not involve racism, sexism, xenophobia or accepting sexual assault,” Zuckerberg wrote. Similarly, Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator, an influential startup incubator, wrote a series of tweets simultaneously attacking Trump for being “abusive, erratic . . . unfit to be President” and also defending his decision to keep Thiel as an adviser to Y Combinator; “YC is not going to fire someone for supporting a major party nominee.” Soon after the controversy arose in mid-October, Thiel announced plans to give this talk to defend himself and the man he wants to be President. His speech is unlikely to change minds about Trump, though it probably will shift how some people think of Thiel. It revealed that, contrary to his pose as a Delphic seer and public considerer of the inconceivable, he is a conventional, right-leaning scold, comfortable with vague assertions. (Thiel also responded to questions about his secret financing of Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker for publishing Hogan’s sex tape, offering the dual argument that he was driven by a desire to give Hogan—a mere “single-digit millionaire”—his day in court and to protect the First Amendment.) Thiel laid out a grim, near-apocalyptic view of America, one in which citizens are “stuck in a broken system” and as he put it in the post-talk discussion, that America “is on the Titanic and we’re going to sink.” He listed familiar reasons for American despair: rising medical costs, a huge trade deficit, student debt. The protagonists in his national drama are Trump voters that he, generously, counts as fifty per cent of the American population. The villains are élites in their coastal bubbles of Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., who “do not intend to tolerate the views of half this country.” These élites, he said, have destroyed our government’s competence. The U.S., he argued, used to do great things like sending people to the moon and building the interstate highway system, but now it can’t do anything right. He supports Donald Trump, he said, because Trump “rejects the false, reassuring stories that tell us everything is fine.” Thiel explained: “Very unusually for a Presidential candidate, he has questioned the core concept of American exceptionalism. He doesn’t think the force of optimism alone can change reality without hard work. Just as it’s about making America great, Trump’s agenda is about making America a normal country.” Thiel defined a normal country as one that doesn’t have a trade deficit, doesn’t fight many wars, and that has a government that “actually does its job.” While some of Thiel’s statements were explicitly wrong—far fewer than half of Americans support Trump, whose unfavorable ratings have hovered around sixty per cent—most were what might be called truth-adjacent. Yes, student debt has risen and there are real issues to address, but it is hardly a sign that the nation is in collapse. (Thiel is famous for railing not just against student debt but also against the idea that a college education is worthwhile.) Trade has, indeed, hurt many Americans, but it has also helped many others—and the help far outweighs the hurt. Also, it is not just a tiny coastal élite who support it; most Americans do. The U.S. has a pretty “normal” trade deficit, lower than that of Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Thiel’s talk felt much like other political speeches. The building blocks of his argument were a mishmash of decontextualized thoughts reassembled to form a simplistic narrative of good and evil, heroes and strawmen. Thiel’s odd but fascinating past statement suggested the possibility of a thoughtful, if idiosyncratic, synthesis of libertarianism and Trumpian populism. But that wasn’t the case. Thiel’s speech—celebrating big government projects, condemning trade and the price of a college education—was as much a rebuke of libertarianism as of Republicanism. Thiel has earned his place among technology visionaries. He created PayPal and was among the first to understand Facebook’s power. I’d be curious to hear what he thinks the next decade holds for Internet-related startups. He used to present radical libertarian views that didn’t catch on but were fun to hear about. He was, for example, probably the most famous supporter of the seasteading movement, which imagined anarcho-libertarian societies built on artificial islands. Some of his statements over the years have been very troubling. In 1998, he co-authored a book condemning affirmative action and diversity efforts on college campuses as anti-white. Ten years later, he wrote, “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” He explained his thinking, in part, by pointing out that women got the vote and women are “notoriously tough for libertarians.” Thiel received a bit of a pass for these offensive ideas because they seemed to be the unfortunate side effects of his radical libertarianism and the privilege of a deep thinker exploring the outer reaches of acceptable discourse. But the man who spoke at the National Press Club had no deep, coherent philosophy. He seemed libertarian at times and, at others, he supported a far more activist government. Throughout, he presented an insufficiently examined enumeration of urges and angers, not a program for governance. His ideas are such an odd assortment of left-wing, right-wing, and wingless nihilism that it’s hard to think of any movement or thinker that shares them—other than Donald Trump.","description":"","keywords":"","time":1478014093,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/peter-thiels-oddly-conventional-defense-of-trump?mbid=rss"},{"title":"What Lady Gaga Finds Appealing in Reel-to-Reel","body":"A week ago, Lady Gaga released her fifth album, “Joanne,” which has a stripped-down sound that is quite different from her previous efforts. She has promoted the album with performances at small night clubs and dive bars, a coming home of sorts to the days when a young Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta would tear up a West Village bar with nothing but her voice and a piano. Beyond Gaga’s performances, what’s unique about “Joanne” is how some of the songs were made. When she announced earlier this year that she was recording an album with the producer Mark Ronson, the press began calling it her analog album. What’s an analog album? Since the late nineteen-nineties, when Pro Tools recording software became widely accepted, the vast majority of music has been recorded digitally onto computer hard drives. The advantages of digital recording are obvious: Pro Tools allows for endless editing and manipulation of sound, from pitch-correcting vocals to splicing up ten takes of a song into one seamless track. Cheaper versions of the software let amateurs record in their homes, which makes music accessible to many more people. Pro Tools also helped create new genres, like modern electronic dance music, mashups, or the stripped backbeat that powers much of today’s hip-hop, by artists like Drake. Analog preceded this. It is music recorded on reel-to-reel tape machines. The only way to edit tape is by slicing it with a razor and attaching it to another piece of the tape, an irreversible process that restricts after-the-fact manipulation. Despite these limitations, over the past several years, a number of musicians, from well-known pop stars to young independents, have begun seeking out studios, producers, and engineers who have the skills to record albums with the tools of the pre-digital era. Early advocates included Gillian Welch and the Foo Fighters (whose 2012 Grammy-winning album, “Wasting Light,” was recorded on vintage equipment in the lead singer Dave Grohl’s garage), as well as analog’s high priest, Jack White, whose Third Man Records not only produces albums in White’s analog studio but regularly records concerts live to vinyl masters, which they press and distribute. This return to analog (which mirrors the revival of vinyl records) may have begun with rock and indie albums, but it is increasingly found across genres. Recent analog albums include work by the neo-soul star D’Angelo, the Wu-Tang veteran Ghostface Killah, Ryan Adams, the Black Keys, and Arcade Fire. “Joanne” is not completely analog, but “at least three songs were recorded to tape,” according to Mark Ronson’s manager. The reasons that musicians record on outdated, archaic, and less flexible equipment are, in some sense, surprising. The assumption is that they want to capture a certain audible sound quality—the oft-mentioned warmth of a tape recording. This is a factor, but is not as significant as people tend to assume. Today’s professional digital recordings offer a sonic quality that only the most discerning audiophiles can distinguish from its analog equivalent, and today most people consume music through tiny headphones, regardless of how the album was originally recorded. “I think the sound quality is one of the smaller reasons why people chose analog,” Chris Mara, who owns a Nashville analog recording studio called Welcome to 1979, said. Mara, an experienced recording engineer, opened the studio eight years ago in a former record-pressing plant, and his business had doubled pretty much every year since. The bands and musicians who seek him out—as well as a growing cluster of other producers who have sprung up around Nashville—tend to be younger and are looking back in time to get away from the heavily manipulated, overly polished sonic atmosphere of modern pop. These musicians want their albums to sound like those made by Led Zeppelin, Sam Cooke, and Bruce Springsteen—not Justin Bieber. By recording like the legends of the twentieth century, they hope to create something new. Another analog studio engineer in Nashville summed it up in simpler terms: “The old shit’s the best shit.” For Mara, the power and flexibility of Pro Tools—with its limitless edits, corrections, and effects—has drawbacks, particularly because it brings with it the endless potential for distraction. “When I’m recording in digital, I’m constantly futzing with reverb and other variables on the computer,” he told me when I visited his wood-panelled studio two years ago to speak with him for my book “The Revenge of Analog.” “Where with analog, I turn the vocals up and it’s there,” he said. “The music just reacts to the tape.” Recording in an analog studio demands more from musicians. After each take, the band, engineers, and producer decide whether what they just recorded was the best version, or whether they should record the whole thing over again. Because of the time and cost involved, Mara said that analog recording sessions tend to be more tightly controlled. Decisions have to be made as the session moves along because mistakes cannot simply be fixed in post-production. “People think limitations are a bad thing,” he said, “but it moves the process forward in a good way. You can easily get lost in the process. It’s easier to stick to the plan when you have limitations.” Sound effects and editing are possible, but they require significant effort, and are used sparingly. Welcome to 1979 has an echo chamber, which is a long concrete hallway with a microphone at one end. Reverb is achieved by playing the music back through a door-size vibrating metal plate that weighs hundreds of pounds. On Pro Tools, both of these effects can be achieved with a few clicks of the mouse, which means they’re deployed all too frequently, along with other plugins, like Auto-Tune and beat correction. Scott McEwen, another analog recording engineer in Nashville, who owns the studio Fry’s Pharmacy, suggested that Pro Tools makes musicians lazy. They settle for a decent take, he said, safe in the knowledge that it can be fixed later. “With tape you just have to man up and do it. It instantly makes you play better. It makes your blood boil in a good way. It makes you nervous.” Just as the choice of technology ultimately influences the way a record sounds, it also shapes any kind of work. By making certain things easier, and offering limitless options, software can be simultaneously liberating and paralyzing. Sometimes the least efficient option, such as paper and pen, leads to better results, or at least uniquely imperfect ones. Ken Scott, a legendary recording engineer who crafted the sound of the Beatles, as well as David Bowie and Pink Floyd, told me that the iconic albums he worked on were all the products of the happy accidents that the analog process imposed—mistakes, screwups, and forced improvisations of the type that can be instantly corrected today in the studio. “We humans cannot achieve perfection,” Scott said. All we can do is embrace our best, imperfect efforts, and move on.","description":"David Sax writes about Lady Gaga’s new album, “Joanne,” which she made with Mark Ronson and which includes some analog recordings on tape.","keywords":"","time":1477673376,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-lady-gaga-finds-appealing-in-reel-to-reel?mbid=rss"},{"title":"The Wealth Gap in Philanthropy","body":"Each year, Stacy Palmer, the editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, compiles a list of the U.S. charities that have raised the most money from private sources. In the twenty-six years that the Philanthropy 400 ranking has been published, one thing has stayed constant: United Way Worldwide is at the top. (The one exception was in 1996, when the Salvation Army briefly displaced it.) But when the results started coming in for this year’s list, which was published on Thursday morning, it became clear that a new No. 1 had emerged—an organization affiliated with Fidelity Investments, called Fidelity Charitable, which has grown to become one of the most influential charities in the world. “I was stunned,” Palmer recalled. The details were especially striking. Fidelity Charitable collected 4.6 billion dollars, a twenty-per-cent increase from the previous year. United Way ranked a distant second, with donations dropping by four per cent, to 3.7 billion dollars. “Not only were they”—Fidelity—“going to be No. 1, but they were going to be No. 1 by a lot,” Palmer remembered realizing. Fidelity Charitable is part of a new, fast-growing class of charities known as donor-advised funds. These charities, which typically attract wealthier donors, let people set up “giving accounts” with funds that can be written off as charitable contributions. They can decide later—even many years later—where to funnel that money. Meanwhile, it is held in investments, with any gains returning to the fund. Fidelity Charitable is the largest of these, but there are other prominent ones: Schwab Charitable and Vanguard Charitable ranked fourth and eleventh, respectively, on this year’s Philanthropy 400. Fidelity’s rise to the top of the list represented a momentous shakeup for a list that, for years, didn’t change much at all. Palmer has worked at the Chronicle since it was founded, in 1988, and recalls the days when United Way was a dominant force. The organization was known for collecting money from middle-class donors through workplace giving programs; those contributions would be funnelled to local programs that provided social services like feeding, clothing, and educating the poor. For a long time, these giving programs and their high-profile annual fund-raising drives were a mainstay of white-collar culture. “You were expected, if you were a good employee and you expected to rise through the ranks, to give to United Way,” Palmer said. United Way is still a huge, influential organization, but its traditional fund-raising methods started becoming obsolete years ago. Employees didn’t like being asked to donate to a single organization that they hadn’t chosen themselves; that annoyance became even more pronounced when the Internet, and then social media, made it easy for people to learn about all kinds of charities, both local and global, not just the high-profile ones. Companies started more-flexible philanthropic programs, often even letting people donate to any charity and matching that contribution. Even United Way now lets workers earmark their donations to be passed through to specific organizations. There’s been a more profound transformation, too. As wealth has become much more concentrated among the rich, it appears that the kinds of charities preferred by wealthier people are seeing disproportional growth. A report this summer from Indiana University found that, last year, donations to education and arts-and-culture causes grew more than for nearly any other category, with a researcher noting that those categories typically include organizations and institutions supported by wealthy donors. According to the National Philanthropic Trust, meanwhile, the average size of donor-advised funds is nearly three hundred thousand dollars, suggesting that they’re disproportionately popular among the rich. The Chronicle found that the Red Cross, Goodwill Industries International, and the Salvation Army all saw their donations fall last year, along with United Way—which Palmer said might have something to do with those organizations’ dependence on middle-class donors. Contributions to Fidelity Charitable and the other top donor-advised funds had double-digit gains, meanwhile, as did several élite universities, such as Stanford. “As the top one per cent has grown richer and richer, the kinds of cause they care about—colleges, museums—have been doing much better,” Palmer said. People in philanthropic circles have been noticing the rise of donor-advised funds, in particular, for several years. I wrote about the trend two years ago, when that year’s Philanthropy 400 was released. At that time, Fidelity Charitable was in second place, after United Way, and critics were beginning to raise concerns about what they saw as legal loopholes related to donor-advised funds. While foundations are required to pay out five per cent of their assets every year, donor-advised funds are not bound by such a requirement, which means money can sit in them for years without being put to any good cause. Also, unlike foundations, donor-advised funds aren’t required to report on the ultimate destination of the contributions they collect, which critics feel isn’t transparent enough. The funds still have their critics but are becoming more accepted. Supporters note that when individuals give directly to charity, they aren’t required to disclose what they’re donating to—why should it be any different when they give through one of these funds? Also, while people can hypothetically get a tax benefit while letting their money sit idle in an account, much of the money in donor-advised funds is being disbursed to other charities: in 2014, the amount granted from the funds represented about eighteen per cent of total assets in them, according to the National Philanthropic Trust. Pamela Norley, the president of Fidelity Charitable, told me that if clients haven’t made a grant for three years, they get a phone call reminding them of the purpose of the fund. “This is about giving,” she said. “This is about making sure that the charities we care about are getting the funds.” Norley noted that the average Fidelity account holds fifteen thousand dollars—well below the average for donor-advised funds in general, though it’s still a large sum—and said that she wants Fidelity’s fund to be accessible to anyone. In the past, Fidelity required a minimum donation of ten thousand dollars to open a giving account; in 2006, it lowered that to five thousand dollars, and Norley said she’s looking at whether to further adjust that minimum. Nonetheless, the displacement of United Way, with its traditionally middle-class donors, by Fidelity Charitable, with its wealthier ones, seems to symbolize how the wealth gap in the U.S. is having an influence on all spheres of public life. “Giving follows the economy, and there’s an income gap in this country,” Brian Gallagher, the president of United Way, told me. Some people who have noted this trend find it worrisome because rich people give disproportionately to naming buildings at hospitals or colleges, or to charities that seem flashy and innovative, and not to workaday social-service organizations. But Gallagher made a different point. He said that philanthropy is only partly about raising funds—what’s more important, he said, is its capacity to mobilize communities around important issues. He pointed to the role of nonprofits, and the individuals involved with them, in changing societal perceptions about issues like civil rights, the role of girls in sports, and drunk driving. “Real social change happens when millions of people get involved, average donors get involved, and work collectively on big issues,” he said.","description":"Vauhini Vara writes about the fund Fidelity Charitable, which, surprisingly, has raised the most money of any charity in the past year.","keywords":"","time":1477584957,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-wealth-gap-in-philanthropy?mbid=rss"},{"title":"A.T. \u0026 T. Wants Time Warner for Eyes, Ears, and Ads","body":"On Saturday, when A.T. \u0026 T. announced that it hopes to acquire Time Warner for more than eighty-five billion dollars, one of its chosen avenues for doing so was to post a video on YouTube. On it, the A.T. \u0026 T. and Time Warner logos appear together onscreen, and then A.T. \u0026 T.’s C.E.O., Randall Stephenson, appears, wearing a jacket, but no tie, in front of a bland corporate backdrop. “The media and communications industries are converging, and, when it comes down to it, premium content always wins,” he says, speaking directly to the camera. He is followed by Time Warner’s C.E.O., Jeff Bewkes, who talks to the camera about strategic priorities and distribution channels while sitting in front of a New York City skyline. This goes on for three minutes. As of Tuesday morning, the video had some nineteen thousand views. It did not go viral. The video could have been an exhibit in A.T. \u0026 T.’s case for acquiring Time Warner. Almost everyone in the U.S. is already online, which leaves little room for growth in the company’s core business—giving people Internet and cell-phone service. The premise of the acquisition is that, since people use A.T. \u0026 T. to access “content”—jargon for the TV episodes, movies, music, photos, and articles that take up so much of our online time—A.T. \u0026 T. might do better by creating some of that material itself. But A.T. \u0026 T. has no experience producing TV episodes or movies—“I don’t know how to run a movie studio,” Stephenson testified Monday on CNBC—so it’d do better to acquire a company that does. (Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. film studios, and television properties including HBO, CNN, and TBS.) Some of this might seem like a stretch: By that logic, should mall owners be trying to buy the Gap? But this thinking has become common among A.T. \u0026 T.’s competitors. In 2013, Comcast, the cable provider, acquired NBCUniversal. Last year, Verizon bought AOL, and this year it agreed to purchase Yahoo. To understand the reasoning, it helps to remember that telecom companies and media companies each have something that the other needs. The companies that provide your cell-phone and home-Internet service have access to detailed personal data—where you are at a given moment and which Web sites you visit, to name a couple. That information is valuable to marketers. But, in order to use it to target their advertisements, they need to reach people while they’re online—and that’s where the media companies, which attract people with content but have limited information about viewers, come in. Imagine, for example, that you’ve been making frequent business trips to the Bay Area. If you’re an A.T. \u0026 T. subscriber and use your smartphone to watch an episode of “Game of Thrones,” on HBO—which is owned by Time Warner—you might start seeing ads for a hotel in downtown San Francisco near where your meetings have been taking place. So far, executives at the telecom and media companies haven’t laid out specific plans for how they’d use customers’ information—the “Game of Thrones” example is just a hypothetical—but they’ve all been explicit about their interest in combining forces when it comes to advertising. “There’s basically going to be more effective advertising,” Bewkes said on CNBC. In a July interview with the Wall Street Journal, Marissa Mayer, the C.E.O. of Yahoo, argued that Verizon’s planned acquisition would lead to “much richer data and much richer targeting.” A.T. \u0026 T. and Verizon are staking their respective futures on slightly different visions. A.T. \u0026 T. seems to be seeking to acquire a producer of high-quality programming and hoping that advertisers will be willing to pay a premium for it. Verizon, meanwhile, appears to be targeting a purveyor of lower-quality but pervasive content—Yahoo’s sites are among the most visited on the Internet—under the assumption that more-modest advertising rates will be made up for by the sheer quantity of ads it can publish. Still, despite the strategic differences, A.T. \u0026 T. and Verizon’s bets on media companies are both, on some level, about advertising. Critics of the A.T. \u0026 T.–Time Warner deal have focussed on the fact that regulators are likely to closely scrutinize the plan and potentially reject it. The antitrust argument against an acquisition is that it would reduce competition and, in turn, lead to higher prices, less choice, and worse customer service. (In addition to providing cellular service, A.T. \u0026 T. owns DirecTV, a satellite-television provider.) So far, much of the analysis of the potential antitrust issues has centered on how A.T. \u0026 T. might use Time Warner’s content: Will A.T. \u0026 T. try to give its own subscribers preferential access to HBO shows, for example? Stephenson dismissed that line of thinking: “I’ve read about this in all these newspapers this morning, about restricting the access to the Time Warner content—it’s nonsensical,” he said on CNBC. He noted that this approach “makes no economic sense,” since it would mean a smaller audience, and therefore hobble the money-making potential, for Time Warner; Stephenson surely is also aware that a strategy that limits A.T. \u0026 T.’s own content would not pass regulatory muster. A question that has gotten less attention is what all this consolidation will mean for online advertising—and, more to the point, the people who are being advertised to. On Monday, Bewkes argued that more targeted advertising, based on more detailed information about consumers, is ultimately good for us. “Most of the cost of all the great programming that’s being made on TV can be borne by advertising, and it can be advertising that is useful to you, rather than something you are not interested in,” he said. In other words, if more of the cost of TV shows is paid for by advertisers, we viewers at home won’t have to bear as much of it—and, meanwhile, the ads we see will be designed just for us. But nothing is truly free. One counterargument—that it’s dangerous for any corporation to have access to too much information about us—has recently been bolstered. Verizon announced its planned acquisition of Yahoo in July; two months later, Yahoo revealed that, in 2014, five hundred million of its users’ accounts had been breached by hackers.","description":"Vauhini Vara on the proposed merger between the telecom companies A.T. \u0026 T. and Time Warner, and what each company may be seeking to gain.","keywords":"","time":1477411256,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/a-t-t-wants-time-warner-for-eyes-ears-and-ads?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Investors Think President Trump Would Make Them Poorer","body":"On September 26th, at 9 P.M., Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump walked onto the stage at Hofstra University, in Hempstead, Long Island, for the first of three scheduled debates. That day was Clinton’s polling nadir. She had fallen, precipitously, from a nearly ninety per cent lock, as predicted by FiveThirtyEight, to a less than fifty-five per cent chance of winning the Presidency. Trump had the momentum. A cough or a slip—of the tongue or the foot—might have done Clinton in, and more than eighty million viewers, eager to see what would happen in this most unpredictable of elections, tuned in for the most-watched Presidential debate in history. As it happens, that evening offered something of a perfect natural experiment into how the people who manage the world’s money view the two candidates. The economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz studied how investors around the world reacted, moment by moment, during a debate in which Trump came out strong and then collapsed. The results were clear: investors believe that Trump would make us considerably poorer and fill our lives with far more risk. In general, you should be skeptical of pundits who try to explain how “the market” reacts to some event or other. Statements on the news like “The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell two per cent today in late trading because of rising concerns about a decrease in factory orders” are pretty much meaningless. Many investors are making billions of decisions for many different reasons, which means it’s often impossible to tease out some explanatory narrative from the mess of data (though reporters certainly try). There are rare moments, though, when the reasons for market movements can be teased out. Wolfers and Zitzewitz realized that the September 26th debate was one of them. The time of the debate, 9 P.M. to 10:30 P.M., Eastern Daylight Time, is about as quiet as global financial markets ever get, with stock markets closed in the U.S. and Europe and not yet open in much of Asia. This means that the chaotic screaming that drowns out analysis during trading hours has quieted to a gentle hum of those few people still sitting at their computers buying and selling stocks, bonds, and currencies. What trading does occur is more likely to be a result of a specific, identifiable event. Wolfers, of the University of Michigan, and Zitzewitz, from Dartmouth, have worked together for more than a decade building a model to understand what financial-market movements can tell us about the economic impact of specific events. Neither of them is especially interested in the value of stocks and other financial products; they want to understand how the economy will function, over all, for everybody. But the stock and currency markets can be helpful. Unlike polls and surveys, these markets are continuous and require participants to put their money at risk. During the debate, Wolfers and Zitzewitz found particular clarity in the trading of S. \u0026 P. 500 futures, which are bets on how the stock market will perform in the future, a helpful guide to relative optimism or pessimism. The price of these futures fell right before the debate began—when Trump’s poll numbers were surging—a sign, it seems, that traders believed a Trump victory would lower the value of their stocks. Those futures stayed put as the debate began. The market was holding its breath during those first moments when Trump seemed to be unusually focussed and cogent. Soon, however, Trump began to unravel, Clinton was literally dancing with glee, and the price of S. \u0026 P. 500 futures shot upward. It rose in steps. Trump admitted to not paying taxes and, boom, the price of futures rose. Trump garbled an answer about cyber security (in which he referred to “the cyber” and his ten-year-old son) and the futures rose, again. In total, over the course of the debate, the price of the futures rose 0.71 per cent, which, in the market, is an enormous increase in so short a period of time. (It was only matched once in recent memory, on the downside, during the disastrous “flash crash” of 2010.) Investors were betting Trump’s chances of being elected had fallen significantly, and that prediction gave them hope for their investments. Wolfers and Zitzewitz found similarly large moves in several other global markets. Mexican peso futures, a bet on the economic health of that nation, gained two per cent in value; U.S. Treasury bonds fell in price, which is a sign of greater confidence in the U.S. government; futures bets on the stock markets of the U.K., Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Singapore all rose in lockstep. One of the most interesting findings was a study of the VIX futures, an index designed to measure how much uncertainty and volatility investors expect to see in the coming months. Sure enough, as Trump’s performance collapsed, those markets priced in far more stability. Over all, the analysis by Wolfers and Zitzewitz suggested that if Clinton wins the election, stock-market value in the U.S. and around the world would be more than ten per cent higher than it would be in a Trump Presidency. This is unusual in at least two ways. There is a larger-than-usual disparity between the market’s sentiment toward the two candidates, and this is the first time in memory that the markets seemed to prefer the Democratic Party candidate. (Wolfers is a Democrat, and his partner, Betsey Stevenson, served on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.) In the first Presidential debate of 2012, for example, when Mitt Romney had a strong debate, investors were thrilled, and sent S. \u0026 P. 500 futures considerably higher. On the evening of the election, when Obama was declared the winner, S. \u0026 P. 500 futures fell sharply. That is the typical pattern. Republicans usually promise the sorts of policies that investors like: tax cuts for wealthy people, more employer-friendly rules, and less regulation, the sorts of things that could increase corporate profits and, therefore, stock value. It’s important to note that optimism about the stock market doesn’t necessarily translate into over-all economic growth or the well-being of all. The stock market might rise because companies find it easier and cheaper to pollute, fire workers, and avoid paying taxes—though all of those might be disastrous for the rest of the country. Trump has promised American business much of what it wants. He has proposed tax cuts that would, effectively, give trillions of dollars to the rich, an elimination of the Dodd-Frank legislation enacted to regulate Wall Street after the financial crisis, and a severe curtailing of environmental rules. That the markets seem fearful of a Trump Presidency suggests that investors—who trade for profit, not to express political views—believe Trump would so devastate commerce in other ways as to more than erase the gains of whatever pro-corporate policies he would enact. These results do not imply that the markets love Clinton, who is proposing increased taxes on the wealthy and an expansion of Wall Street regulations. Wolfers told me it’s more a sign that they hate her less than they hate Trump. What, precisely, do the markets fear about Trump? His anti-trade rhetoric is certainly troubling to those who care about stock and currency value; less trade would hurt profits for multinational companies and the currencies of our leading trading partners. Wolfers says that trade is not enough to explain the magnitude of the expected loss of value under a Trump Administration, nor can it explain the increase in uncertainty. He says that the markets express a feeling that so many others have: we have no idea what Trump could do with all the power of the Presidency, but whatever it is it wouldn’t be good.","description":"Adam Davidson on two researchers whose data suggest that investors across the globe believe a Donald Trump Presidency would create far too much risk.","keywords":"","time":1477338033,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/investors-think-president-trump-would-make-them-poorer?mbid=rss"},{"title":"What Barnes \u0026 Noble Doesn’t Get About Bookstores","body":"In April, Leonard Riggio announced that he was stepping away from Barnes \u0026 Noble, the business he bought forty-five years ago and transformed into the world’s largest brick-and-mortar bookstore chain. Come September, Riggio, now seventy-five, would happily retire. Or so he claimed. Though he had ceded the title of chief executive in 2002, Riggio remained the executive chairman and the soul and supreme authority of Barnes \u0026 Noble. Still, it seemed like a safe time to step down. Pummelled in recent years by Amazon’s dominance over the industry, and the hangover of the recession, Barnes \u0026 Noble had closed more than ten per cent of its stores and fended off hostile takeovers, but it was still alive. Its losses had levelled off, and sales were actually growing in many categories, including board games, vinyl records, and even some categories of books, the non-digital kind (like coloring books for grownups). In March, the company announced plans to open its first new stores in several years, and in June it unveiled its potential future: smaller locations, with full-service bars and restaurants, and a more boutique feel. It seemed to be a move away from the model of “superstores” that the company once defined itself by. But then, in August, Riggio and the board he leads ousted Ron Boire, who had lasted less than a year as chief executive, and was the third C.E.O. to pass through Barnes \u0026 Noble since 2010.* A few weeks later, quarterly financial results presented shareholders with the cold reality of Barnes \u0026 Noble’s troubles. Losses were mounting across the board—particularly for the Nook, the company’s troubled wireless reading device—and sales were falling more quickly than expected. The company’s stock was almost a quarter of what it had been a decade ago. In response, Riggio has returned to the chief executive’s chair, ostensibly until a suitable replacement is found. The key question for Riggio now is figuring out what purpose Barnes \u0026 Noble serves today. Amazon dominates the industry with low prices and a vast selection, and is even flirting with brick-and-mortar bookstores, having opened two in the past year. Independent bookstores—once assumed to be on their way to extinction—own the romantic notion of a bookstore as a place, like a church or a social club, where communities are nurtured. Barnes \u0026 Noble is stuck in the middle, a giant saddled with hundreds of huge stores, and an image of corporate sameness in a market that has increasingly come to treasure defiantly independent bookstores. In redefining the company’s purpose, Riggio is looking to emulate the very businesses Barnes \u0026 Noble once threatened. After two decades in which the number of independent booksellers decreased by half, those bookstores are now coming back. The American Booksellers Association noted a consistent increase in new store openings over the past seven years, with growth of more than thirty per cent. These include small urban stores, such as Brooklyn’s Greenlight and Word, but also regional chains, like Bull Moose, in New England. In a recent phone interview, Riggio said he believes that the biggest shift in the book retail business (besides the one caused by the Internet and Amazon) was fundamentally demographic. Over the past fifteen years, as young Americans and their families returned to urban centers in significant numbers, the market for independent bookstores became viable once again. “The retailers that are now resurgent in those areas are typically populated by smaller stores, because the architecture of those spaces are small,” he said. As far back as 2000, Riggio said that he believed Barnes \u0026 Noble should open smaller stores (the company’s typical superstores are more than twenty-five-thousand square feet), in denser, more pedestrian-friendly locations. But, at the time, business was great, the suburban power centers were still growing, and the idea never translated into concrete action. “You blow some and you get some right,” he said, reflecting on the missed opportunity. “Timing is everything.” Ultimately, this hurt Barnes \u0026 Noble, whose core business rests on big numbers of huge stores, even in urban centers like New York. The move to open five smaller concept stores—about twenty per cent smaller than its average store—in the suburbs of Minneapolis, Sacramento, Dallas, Washington, D.C., and New York City, sometime in the next few months, seems a somewhat belated attempt to remedy this. Riggio believes that the same type of person shops at small independent bookstores, Amazon, and Barnes \u0026 Noble. “The No. 1 consideration of where someone will shop is how close it is to where they are,” he said. “It has nothing to do with pedigree or branding. If there’s no bookstore close to them, they’re more likely to buy online. If there’s one close, they’re more likely to buy if it’s a block away.” His target market is the same as other book retailers: young, educated customers, and women with small children. The only thing that he believes distinguishes new-generation independent bookstores from Barnes \u0026 Noble is better food and drink, which is something he hopes to capture in the new concept stores. Those stores will have Scandinavian-looking cafés with fully licensed bars, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. While a number of successful independent bookstores have cafés and good coffee, Riggio may be missing the bigger lesson of independent bookstores and the intangible experience of shopping there. The independent bookstores that have proved successful are uniquely suited to the community they’re in. Some are big. Some are small. Some are homey and stitched together with found shelving. Others are practically works of art and architecture. They stock the books that the community wants, and, while their selections are minuscule compared with Barnes \u0026 Noble, the staff can speak to the books on those shelves with authority. In other words, they are all different. An analogous example sits right across from the flagship Barnes \u0026 Noble, in Union Square, in New York City: a greenmarket that draws in people who want to browse, socialize, and take photos of pumpkins, even if they can buy the same foods and products at the Whole Foods Market on the south side of the square. The brick-and-mortar stores that do best today are the ones people want to shop in, not the ones they have to. Riggio argues that, despite being a large corporation, Barnes \u0026 Noble can serve a community function. “The people who shop at our stores see us as the local Barnes \u0026 Noble,” he said, noting that the company basically transformed bookstores from places filled with products to retail environments with comfortable seating where patrons were encouraged to linger. Part of the company’s plans for revamping its retail includes more on-floor sales staff with better information, and increased autonomy for store buyers to stock the merchandise that’s relevant to the local customer base. “We have been community centers since we entered the business,” Riggio said. “You can’t just dismiss us with the broad brush of ‘Well, that’s a chain.’ Otherwise, you deny that the three billion books we sold ever happened.” But to run six hundred and thirty-eight stores, most the size of several independent bookstores, you need standardization, in everything from design and selection to the clothes employees wear. It’s unlikely that Barnes \u0026 Noble will ever shrink to a scale where it can shake off that uniformity, nor would it be wise to try. While many love to bash Barnes \u0026 Noble as a disrupted dinosaur, and gleefully talk about its impending demise, the reality is that the world of American books, and bookstores, would be poorer without it. If you live in certain areas of the country, Barnes \u0026 Noble is your local bookstore. It’s where you go to hear authors speak, where you stock up on Christmas gifts, and where you take your children to hear stories. Every industry needs its standard-bearer, just as the third-wave coffee shops need their Starbucks to rebel against. If Barnes \u0026 Noble does persevere, it will undoubtedly look different from the Barnes \u0026 Noble we see today. Likely it will resemble something akin to a more human-scale bookstore chain. That may mean closing more stores, though Riggio wouldn’t comment on that. “You look at bookstores and a book market as more of an evolving issue than this type of store or that type of store appearing or disappearing,” he said. “It doesn’t really happen like that. It plays out over a long period of time.” For the sake of the millions of readers across America who still see Barnes \u0026 Noble as their neighborhood bookstore, let’s hope it does. *This sentence has been corrected to clarify that Leonard Riggio does not control the Barnes \u0026 Noble board.","description":"David Sax on Leonard Riggio, the head of Barnes \u0026 Noble, and the struggling chain’s efforts to compete with Amazon and independent bookstores.","keywords":"","time":1477047656,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/what-barnes-noble-doesnt-get-about-bookstores?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Ivanka Trump Fights to Save the Brand","body":"“I hate the word ‘surrogate.’ What does that mean?” Ivanka Trump said on a stage on Wednesday morning at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel, California. “At one point, major newspapers were writing that I was running to be a Vice-Presidential candidate. I’m, like, ‘No, I’m a daughter. I don’t express my views on policy, with one exception.’ “ That exception, she said, was affordable child care, and she proudly took responsibility for employing her daughterly influence to convince her father, Donald Trump, to incorporate a child-care tax deduction and dependent-care saving accounts into his policy platform, because matters affecting working women were “very core to her professional mission.” Still, she insisted, “I’m not a surrogate. I’m a daughter.” Ivanka was appearing at the Fortune Most Powerful Women conference, an annual gathering of some of the most accomplished women in corporate America. She had spoken at the conference before, but this year the stop took on an obviously larger significance. Rather than simply reaffirming her celebrity presence among the female entrepreneurs and C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 companies in attendance, Ivanka was trying to salvage her brand, which is built around young professional women and working mothers, two groups who appear to be recoiling from her father’s Presidential candidacy in large numbers. In addition to her role at her father’s company, the Trump Organization, where she is the executive vice-president, Ivanka runs her own sub-brand, producing a line of sheaths, blouses, and cocktail dresses aimed at women who go into an office every day. Her eponymous Web site supports that brand with tips for preparing family-friendly dinners on busy weeknights and reducing stress with yoga at your desk, and her Instagram feed (with 1.2 million followers) offers a window into a world of aspirational affluence in which her three children always appear in spotless pinafores and polo shirts and Ivanka herself seems unconcerned about the possibility of getting spit-up or tomato sauce on her own silks, satins, and cashmeres. She has a book coming out in the spring, called “Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success,” in which she attempts to position herself as an up-and-coming Sheryl Sandberg. (“Today’s generation of women is the first to be able to unabashedly embrace the fact that our lives are multidimensional,” the Amazon writeup promises. “For us, it’s about working smarter, not harder; integrating our personal passions and priorities with our professional goals in order to architect lives we love.”) Unfortunately, the darker forces of her father’s political campaign are threatening to ruin everything. There are a few people surrounding Donald Trump who, for their own reasons, have chosen to step in front of the bus of his campaign—his wife, Melania, for one, and even Rudy Giuliani. They arguably didn’t have much to lose, and stood to gain significantly, if things had worked out. The one person who does appear to have a great deal at stake in terms of reputation and personal ambition in Trump’s flame-throwing final stand is Ivanka Trump. Ivanka’s success is built on the Trump brand and the Trump name; her persona derives from her image as her father’s protégée. Donald Trump also needs his daughter by his side. When he seemed boorish, offensive, ignorant, or even predatory—at times, an hourly occurrence—a modern, emancipated daughter was there to soften the father’s edges. She and her siblings were enlisted to help marshal the “millennial vote.” Through it all, the immense free publicity generated by Trump’s ability to dominate cable news dovetailed conveniently with Ivanka’s business. She embraced the family philosophy of turning everything into an opportunity for personal enrichment; the morning after she introduced her father at the Republican National Convention, she broadcast on Twitter an image of herself wearing one of her fashion label’s dresses on the stage with the exhortation: “Shop Ivanka’s look from her #RNC speech.” Appearing at the Fortune conference in her own “cap-sleeve embellished sheath dress,” a red number with a high slit up the side ($148 at Lord \u0026 Taylor), Ivanka tried to present a challenging argument, that she was both an important influence on her father yet completely removed from anything he did. When Nancy Gibbs, the managing editor of Time magazine, who interviewed Ivanka onstage, asked about the tape that was recently made public in which Trump boasted about grabbing and assaulting women, Ivanka said that she had accepted his apology. “He recognizes it was crude language. He was embarrassed that he said those things, and he apologized,” she said, maintaining a calm, unflappable demeanor and talking-point discipline in a high-pressure situation, something that her father generally is unable to do. “That’s not language consistent with any conversation I’ve ever had with him, or any conversation I’ve ever overheard, so it was a bit jarring to hear. I think he was sincere in his apology.” She went on, “When things have happened in this campaign that have been tough for us as a family . . . when things have been said that are mischaracterizations, that are false, and not consistent with his intent, we talk about it. We have a very open dialogue.” Most of the women at the summit had paid ten thousand dollars to be there, and Gibbs played to her audience when she turned the conversation to business. “You’ve spent a lot of time building a very successful retail brand, whose sort of core theme was about female empowerment, and yet that identity, for the moment, has been overtaken by your role as one of the most visible members of the inner circle of the Republican nominee, who just in the last two weeks has body-shamed a Miss Universe contestant and appeared in that tape and suggested that other women who have accused him were too unattractive to have been assaulted,” Gibbs said at one point. “Does that put you in an impossible position?” A look of exasperation passed across Ivanka’s face before she composed a smooth, careful response. “My brand was launched far before the Presidential cycle commenced and will continue long afterwards,” she said. “I’ve always tried to maintain complete separation between that and the campaign. With that said, you know, one of the challenging things is just operating, living one’s life, with the intensity and the scrutiny of this process is a very hard thing actually to do.” She went on to say that nothing could prepare a person to be the child of a Presidential candidate, and that the media has been “vicious” to her and her family. It was hard not to feel a bit sorry for her when she described being followed by a pack of photographers on the way to drop her children at school in the morning. Ivanka said that she often didn’t recognize the person—her father—the press portrayed. Still, the example of media unfairness that she complained most about involved not the mistreatment of her father but of the Trump business. The choice seemed an intentional part of her effort to align herself with Trump the Brand, not necessarily Trump the Politician. Gibbs followed up by asking whether, in light of the fact that the Trump brand is defined by “winning,” her father was prepared to concede the election if he lost. “Well, look, my father is in this to win it,” Ivanka said. She said that she’d heard many anecdotes about people, male and female, who planned to vote for Trump but were too embarrassed to go public with it. “I’m not interested in talking about alternative outcomes, and of course I think my father will always do the right thing,” she said. “That’s the type of person he is.” She added, “He’ll either win or he won’t win, and I believe he’ll accept the outcome either way.” Donald Trump’s strategy all along has been to force a change of subject in the national discussion by making outrageous statements or insinuations at critical moments, a technique he employed effectively once again after talk of sexual-assault allegations against him began to dominate the press. After her interview at the Ritz-Carlton, Ivanka flew to Las Vegas to accompany her father to the final Presidential debate. Toward the end, Chris Wallace, the moderator, asked Donald Trump essentially the same question that Gibbs had asked his daughter. The father’s answer probably didn’t surprise the daughter, but it might have dismayed her. He had, for the moment, chosen the politician over his brand: “I will look at it at the time. I will keep you in suspense, O.K.?”","description":"Sheelah Kolhatkar on Ivanka Trump’s appearance at a conference targeted at women in business, and Ivanka’s defense of her personal brand.","keywords":"","time":1476992170,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/ivanka-trump-fights-to-save-the-brand?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Top-Down, Bottom-Up Urban Design","body":"About three years ago, the sociologist Richard Sennett asked his friend and colleague Joan Clos, the executive director of the United Nations Human Settlements Program, if he had ever read the Athens Charter, by the architect Le Corbusier. Published in 1943, the charter shaped the design of European and American cities for decades after the Second World War. It presented a set of ninety-four tenets that cities should follow to become functional and efficient. (No. 29: “High-rise apartments placed at wide distances apart liberate ground for large open spaces.”) Clos had indeed read it. “He said he found it a fiction,” Sennett recalled. The Athens Charter was rigid—it proposed a strict formula for all cities to follow with no regard for geography or local culture—and aimed to simplify how cities worked, rather than to promote more complex ways of living. Over the years, Le Corbusier’s ideas have been credited with destroying neighborhoods and street life, but they have also continued to influence city design, from the growth of gated communities to car-centric city streets. The idea of the charter, its influence and failings, stayed with both men. Clos and Sennett, who is a professor at New York University and the London School of Economics, soon met again in London, this time joined by the sociologists Saskia Sassen (who teaches at Columbia University and to whom Sennett is married) and Ricky Burdett (of the L.S.E.), and they decided it was time to write a new Athens Charter, one that would correct Le Corbusier’s errors and outline a more flexible way to design cities, particularly the overpopulated metropolises in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, on which Clos focusses at the United Nations. For the next two years, Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett convened workshops with and commissioned papers from leading urban scholars and architects, many of whom were from developing countries. They returned repeatedly to the Athens Charter to guide their discussions. “We engaged in a conversation with it,” Sassen told me, “and, in having the conversation, we demolished it a bit.” As Sennett put it, “Our critique is just, very simply, that it’s the wrong utopia.” Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett will unveil their response to Le Corbusier in Quito, Ecuador, this week, at Habitat III, the U.N.’s conference on urbanization in the developing world, held only once every twenty years, and overseen this year by Clos. (Thirty thousand planners, architects, researchers, and city officials are in attendance.) The trio decided to call their work the Quito Papers, and, though they are not an official U.N. document, they serve as a sort of conceptual foundation for the U.N.’s thinking about cities. Their project argues that three major forces are shaping today’s developing cities—climate change; big data; and informality, that is, the improvisational, contingent spaces in which city dwellers live and work—and that dealing with these forces requires city planners to design with more flexibility and public engagement than Le Corbusier was able to conceive. Clos included excerpts of the report in the conference’s e-book, and on Wednesday evening, for the last of the week’s three major plenary sessions, Clos will moderate a discussion with Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett on the project. In advance of their trip to Quito, I spoke to Sennett and Sassen about Habitat III and Le Corbusier and about urban housing, inequality, density, democracy, and, of course, Jane Jacobs. Jacobs’s book “The Death and Life of American Cities” presented an earlier critique of Le Corbusier, and what’s particularly interesting about the Quito Papers is the way they prompt a new consideration of Jacobs’s model of city-making, too. Revisiting Le Corbusier, it seems, means revisiting Jacobs and, perhaps, trying to embrace the conflict they represent. Le Corbusier developed the ideas that would inform the Athens Charter in Paris, and then in New York, in the nineteen-twenties and thirties. He was particularly alarmed by these cities’ poor neighborhoods and their overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. As he wrote in his charter (tenet No. 4), “Chaos has entered into the cities.” Le Corbusier called for slums to be torn down to make way for high-rise buildings that he believed would bring order to the streets and the lives of the poor. His work inspired the now discredited idea of housing people, particularly poor people, in tall towers that limit social interaction. In fact, Sennett spent part of his childhood in one of the most infamous Corbusian housing projects, Cabrini-Green, in Chicago. He lived there with his mother in the nineteen-forties, and described it in a memoir as “a project that denied people control over their own lives.” The city demolished Cabrini-Green, which had become riddled with crime, in 2011. Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett are presenting the Quito Papers at a time of chaos for many cities in the developing world. The U.N. estimates that more than a billion people in the world’s slums lack access to clean water, and even more to basic sanitation and toilets. And these settlements will only become more crowded. By 2030, the U.N. estimates, six of every ten people will live in cities, with ninety per cent of this growth happening in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The impulse among many officials in these cities is not unlike Le Corbusier’s—namely, to demolish slums and build new towers. But, rather than razing and re-housing, which Sassen says can often destroy existing social and economic networks, the scholars call for cities to engage with the informal, improvised structures and practices already on the ground. As Sennett put it, “what we need to do is think of the city as a more open system, which accumulates complexity, and in which those complexities have to be worked with, rather than simplified.” Take school buildings. In many cities, schools might be “built into factories, or into back rooms of housing settlements. And rather than see that there’s something wrong about that—this is what I mean about the break with the spirit of Corbusier—we should be working with making that kind of school better,” he said. Sennett and his colleagues argue for city plans defined by flexibility, rather than by right and wrong answers. Housing is another realm in which cities should upend traditional thinking, the scholars say. Sennett cited the work of the Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena, who won the 2016 Pritzker Prize for designing what he has called “half a good house.” To reduce costs, builders construct the structural components of a two-story house but leave the rest unfinished, for a family to complete as needed. It’s a way to build lots of modest housing cheaply and sustainably, and for people to define, through years of gradual labor, how they will live. “That is the stuff of making a life in a place,” Sennett said, “rather than waving a magic wand and putting people in five thousand towers.” What Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett’s work does share with the Athens Charter is a sense of ambition and scale. It argues that the challenges facing developing cities require planners to design for “the totality of the city,” as Sennett put it, rather than solely at the local, community level—a position that places the Quito Papers and Sennett at odds with an old friend, Jane Jacobs. Jacobs developed her ideas about cities in the nineteen-fifties and sixties, studying how people make city neighborhoods bustling and safe, and fighting large highway projects that uproot the poor. Sennett, who knew Jacobs well, sometimes joined her on the front lines. She argued that the best way to prevent destructive, top-down urban renewal, as practiced by Robert Moses and Le Corbusier, was through grass-roots planning, neighborhood by neighborhood. Sennett and his colleagues agree that imposition from above doesn’t work, but “going to the other extreme and saying, ‘well, it’s all local conditions’ is no more satisfactory,” he said. “Many of the issues that confront cities today”—transportation, utilities, inequality—“need to be scaled up from the community level.” In a sense, this difference with Jacobs illuminates the Quito Papers’ defining question: how to design cities that provide structure and empower people to create and control their own lives. In the coming months, Sennett, Sassen, and Burdett will take their research on a “world road show,” beginning in Paris and then going to Beijing, London, and New York. They have made a short film on their work, and will eventually publish the Papers as a book. Throughout our conversation, Sennett reiterated that the Quito Papers, like Habitat III, address the challenges facing developing cities and not cities like London and New York. But there are certain questions at the heart of the document, like the question of scale, and how to have productive conflict between the grass roots and the official—between Jane Jacobs and Le Corbusier—that feel as if they are speaking to these cities, too. Take the topic of transport planning—“not something that keeps me awake at night with pleasure,” Sennett said. It’s the kind of problem, like sanitation, or access to water, or even climate change, that requires public input and citywide planning, and sustained conflict between the two. As Sennett put it, “You can’t make a transport system that’s locally based. You have to start with a whole, and then decide how the parts sort themselves out.”","description":"Elizabeth Greenspan on a trio of researchers who have created a plan to restructure urbanization in the developing world.","keywords":"","time":1476849621,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/top-down-bottom-up-urban-design?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Apple, Samsung, and Good Design—Inside and Out","body":"Apple’s design prowess, long celebrated—even venerated—has taken some nasty hits since the release of the iPhone 7. Technology watchers have been dismissive. “Apple has squandered its once-commanding lead in hardware and software design,” Farhad Manjoo, of the New York Times, wrote. He added, “As competitors have borrowed and even begun to surpass Apple’s best designs, what was iconic about the company’s phones, computers, tablets and other products has come to seem generic.” This is a conundrum for Apple. Its design is iconic—and pleasing—enough for others to blatantly imitate, making it hard to escape the ubiquity of its own design. Echoes of the iPhone are everywhere. Xiaomi’s phones and Google’s new Pixel are designed to fool you into thinking that they just might be an iPhone. Samsung, famously, was found to have infringed Apple’s iPhone design patents, a case that made its way to the Supreme Court. In 2012, a jury told Samsung to pay a billion dollars in damages to Apple. The award was reduced to five hundred and forty-eight million dollars last year, and Samsung is now challenging about four hundred million of that amount. The Supreme Court will weigh in on whether damages should be awarded based on the entire phone, or just on those parts that infringed Apple’s patents. That Samsung is facing such steep costs suggests the appeal of the original Apple design. When I asked John Maeda, the former president of the Rhode Island School of Design, why, then, people have turned on the design of the iPhone 7, he pointed out that perhaps these critics “seem to believe that there’s some as yet unimaginable transcendence that can happen in a small, palm-shaped, rectangular device.” Maeda said that he spent time with designers at Sony and felt their frustration designing a television set “because all you can really do is design the rectangle that the TV sits within. . . . Everything else around that screen really doesn’t matter.” The same problem holds for the iPhone. All that matters is the screen—its size, brightness, and resolution. “Now that we have all those dimensions sated, it’s basically the challenge of designing a TV set all over again,” he added. Standing out in such an environment is not easy. Car design is less restricted, but still, every decade, you see car designs react to new technologies and new regulations and end up in a place where they become forgettable. This is not true of Porsche. As one Porsche design expert is said to have told his underlings, “You are not here to design the most beautiful sports car, you are here to design the best Porsche.” The design language of the Porsche brand is “iconic.” In 1947, Porsche began work on its 356. In many ways it was like the original iPhone. It wasn’t perfect. It was underpowered. But it was streamlined and aerodynamic. From the 356 to the 911, a distinctive marriage of form, function, design, and brand ruled every design. It became the core around which Porsche was built. Porsche’s and Apple’s design philosophies are similar. Much like the 356, the original iPhone was about defining a foundation for the future. It was different from other phones on the market—it made a rectangular touchscreen the main way to interact, displacing buttons and keypads. Now the iPhone is the essence of a phone. The MacBook, the iPad, and the iPhone are all a study in constant refinement. Sure, there are product designs that leave us scratching our heads—having a USB-C charging port on one laptop and something else on another, for example—but place the first iPhone next to the latest one and you can see their common language. The same goes for the iPad and the MacBook. “Families of aspirational products share a strong design language—the code which describes how they look, feel, and function. Like a thriving spoken tongue, a vibrant design language is shaped by where it’s been, yet it also evolves by appropriating new bits from contemporary culture,” Diego Rodriguez, a partner at IDEO, a San Francisco-based design studio, said. “This is the case with Apple, where you can clearly see design elements from the original PowerBook in the iPhone 7.” Design, however, is more than just looks, a point that has been well illustrated by Samsung and the terrible trouble it has had with its flagship device, the Galaxy Note 7. When it was released, reviewers were blown away by its ravishing good looks. “The Note 7 is Samsung’s best device ever, and arguably the best big phone ever made,” the Verge wrote. “It has a gorgeous, symmetrical design that looks particularly stunning in Coral Blue,” CNET gushed. The Wall Street Journal bubbled with joy: “I love the curved edges of the screen and how it makes the footprint of the phone smaller.” Now Samsung is suffering an enormous setback. The Galaxy Note 7 has been found to overheat and explode, and the South Korean giant has withdrawn millions of units from the market and ceased production of the device. The debacle will cost the company about three billion dollars, and a lot more in terms of the brand’s reputation. As I read the coverage of the iPhone 7 design, Samsung’s troubles, and the legal rumbles between Apple and Samsung, it became obvious that we, collectively, have a misunderstanding of what design is, especially when it comes to connected devices. Many technology reviewers make the very human mistake of thinking about beauty and design as skin deep, overlooking what’s inside. I look at the new iPhone 7—and particularly the iPhone 7 Plus—and see huge technological leaps. Matthew Panzarino, the editor of the technology news site Techcrunch, recently wrote, “If you’re a fan of reading the Apple tea leaves to see what it’s going to do next, and in turn how it will influence the industry, then the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the most interesting iPhones ever.” Apple’s iPhone 7 devices are truly computing monsters—the iPhone 7 is said to outpace some Macs, not to mention other phones. Its core processor is forty per cent faster than its predecessor and a hundred and twenty times faster than the original iPhone. The iPhone 7 internals are able to do complex and intensive computing tasks right on the device, instead of trying to send them to the cloud for heavy lifting. To some, including David Smith, the chief executive of Wearality, a virtual-reality company, the iPhone’s oomph makes it a perfect platform for giving augmented and virtual-reality applications a big boost. “Today, these phones are supercomputers,” he said. “As soon as we can turn your phone into an IMAX theatre, that’s game over.” The Apple design that so many find boring is doing what it’s supposed to do. It hides the technological complexities—chips, storage, and batteries—revealing itself with the power of an app or a perfect photograph. In comparison, Samsung, in a race to beat Apple and pack more technology into its devices, forgot that, in the end, performance matters above all else. “The Note 7 had more features and was more complex than any other phone manufactured,” Park Chul-wan, the former director of the Center for Advanced Batteries at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute, told the New York Times. “In a race to surpass the iPhone, Samsung seems to have packed it with so much innovation it became uncontrollable.” But integrating core and complex technologies is table stakes in technology business—especially in smartphones. There is no excuse for Samsung to fail at something so basic. The seamless interaction between the technologies hidden behind the screen, the software, and our services is good design. Apple thus far has made sure that it gets most of that experience right—especially the stuff under the hood. Perhaps the next time someone criticizes its designs, we should remember: good design means your phone doesn’t explode.","description":"Om Malik on the critical response to the design of Apple’s iPhone 7, and the problems plaguing Samsung and its Galaxy Note 7.","keywords":"","time":1476763241,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/apple-samsung-and-good-design-inside-and-out?mbid=rss"},{"title":"The Meaning of Open Trade and Open Borders","body":"Near the end of his 1817 treatise, “On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,” David Ricardo advanced the “law of comparative advantage,” the idea that each country—not to mention the world that countries add up to—would be better off if each specialized in the thing it did most efficiently. Portugal may be more productive than Britain in both clothmaking and winemaking; but if Portugal is comparatively more productive in winemaking than clothmaking, and Britain the other way around, Portugal should make the wine, Britain the cloth, and they should trade freely with one another. The math will work, even if Portuguese weavers will not, at least for a while—and even if each country’s countryside will come to seem less pleasingly variegated. The worker, in the long run, would be compensated, owing to “a fall in the value of the necessaries on which his wages are expended.” Accordingly, Ricardo argued in Parliament for the abolition of Britain’s “corn laws,” tariffs on imported grain, which protected the remnants of the landed aristocracy, along with their rural retainers. Those tariffs were eventually lifted in 1846, a generation after his death; bread got cheaper, and lords got quainter. The case for free trade, embodied in deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, remains at bottom Ricardo’s. And the long run is still working out pretty much as he assumed. The McKinsey Global Institute, or M.G.I., reported in 2014 that some twenty-six trillion dollars in goods, services, and financial investments crossed borders in 2012, representing about thirty-six percent of global G.D.P. The report, looking country by country, reckoned that burgeoning trade added fifteen to twenty-five per cent to global G.D.P. growth—as much as four hundred and fifty billion dollars. “Countries with a larger number of connections in the global network of flows increase their GDP growth by up to 40 percent more than less connected countries do,” the M.G.I. said. But the case against free trade seems also to be based on Ricardo’s premises, albeit with heightened compassion for the Portuguese weavers and British wheat farmers. American critics—Bernie Sanders, earnestly; Donald Trump, cannily—argue that trade decimated U.S. manufacturing by forcing American products into competition with countries where wages, labor, and environmental standards are not nearly as strong as those in America, or by ignoring how some countries, especially China, manipulate their currency to encourage exports. Sanders launched his post-primary movement, “Our Revolution,” in late August, with an e-mail to potential donors. The most conspicuous demand to rally the troops was opposition to the T.P.P. “Since 2001, nearly 60,000 manufacturing plants in this country have been shut down,” the e-mail said, “and we have lost almost 5 million decent-paying manufacturing jobs. NAFTA alone led to the loss of almost three-quarters of a million jobs—the Permanent Normalized Trade Agreement with China cost America four times that number: almost 3 million jobs.” These agreements “are not the only reason” why manufacturing in the United States has declined, the e-mail goes on, but “they are important factors.” Such evidence for why the T.P.P. should be thrown out is hard to dispute, since the e-mail doesn’t say what jobs were gained because of past deals, or explore what other “factors” may be important. President Obama, the champion of the T.P.P., may grant that certain provisions of the deal might be strengthened in favor of American standards without agreeing with “Our Revolution” on what’s bathwater and what’s baby. What’s clearer is that the anti-trade message is hitting home, especially among the hundred and fifty million Americans, about sixty-one per cent of the adult population, with no post-high-school degree of any kind. The investor Jeremy Grantham in July wrote an op-ed in Barron’s noting that some ten million net new jobs were created in the U.S. since the lows of 2009 (the actual number being fifteen million), while “a remarkable 99 percent” excluded people without a university degree. That’s a crisis, not of unemployment but of unemployability, which backshadows skepticism about the T.P.P. and trade as a whole. Trump’s lead over Hillary Clinton among less-well-educated white voters remains solid, in spite of his alleged sexual predations; a large number of voters remain drawn to his grousing about the balance-of-trade deficit—which he presents as if it were a losing football score. Clinton has apparently decided to pass up the teachable moment, pretty much adopting Sanders’s anti-trade line, though her private views almost certainly remain more nuanced. In an e-mail exposed by the WikiLeaks hack, purporting to detail a conversation between Clinton aides, she allegedly told Banco Itau, a Brazilian bank, in 2013, that she favored, at “some time in the future,” a “hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders”—a curious case of a leak embarrassing a candidate by showing her to be more visionary and expert than she wants to appear. The anxiety is understandable, but the focus on trade deals seriously underestimates the changes that have reshaped global corporations over the past generation. Trade, increasingly, is mostly not in finished goods like Portuguese wine. It is, rather, in components moving within corporate networks—that is, from federated sources toward final assembly, then on to sales channels, in complex supply chains. An estimated sixty per cent of international trade happens within, rather than between, global corporations: that is, across national boundaries but within the same corporate group. It is hard to shake the image of global corporations as versions of post-Second World War U.S. multinationals: huge command-and-control pyramids, replicating their operations in places where, say, customers are particularly eager or labor is particularly cheap. This is wrong. Corporations are hierarchies of product teams, which live in a global cloud. “Made in America” is an idealization. The product manager of the Chevrolet Volt, which Obama singled out at the time of the auto bailout, told me in 2009 that the car was a kind of Lego build: the design was developed by an international team in Michigan, the chassis came from the U.S., the battery cells from Korea, the small battery-charging engine from Germany, the electrical harnesses from Mexico, suspension parts from Canada, and smartphone-integration software from Silicon Valley. More and more, the design of products and services happens in distributed hubs. The serendipitous sourcing of technologies and customer characteristics, the lowering of transaction costs, the trade flows enabled by accelerated financing and logistics—all of these—presume growing network integration and social media, the latter increasingly important to glean marketing data. The point is that each component, and each step in production, adds value differently. Where value is added will depend on what corporate accountants call “cost structure”: how much of the component or step requires local materials, or unskilled labor, or skilled labor wedded to expensive capital equipment, or high transportation costs, and so forth. Some components, like the fuel injectors assembled into the Volt’s German engine, required high-technology production systems. Labor was a trivial part of the cost structure, and the engine could be built in the highest-wage region on the planet. Harnesses, in contrast, which required a much higher proportion of manual labor—and were relatively easy to ship—were inevitably sourced from places where workers make as little as a tenth as much as Americans, thousands of miles away. No tariffs can reverse this trend, and no currency manipulation can drive it. Between 2005 and 2012, the M.G.I. found, thirty-eight per cent of trade derived from “emerging economies,” up from fourteen per cent in 1990. In principle, the production of virtually any component or assembly operation could be robotized and moved to high-wage countries—but only so long as demand is great enough, and design specifications stable enough, to justify huge scale and hundreds of millions, if not billions, in upfront investments. But that’s not good news for American workers with little education. Robotic lines employ few, comparatively highly trained workers. The Atlantic’s Andrew McGill reported recently that American manufacturing output has actually continued to grow steadily, but employment in manufacturing peaked at nineteen and a half million, in 1979; today, only twelve million work in manufacturing. Deloitte figured that, in 2011, some six hundred thousand manufacturing jobs went unfilled in the U.S., largely owing to a dearth of skilled workers. So global trade only puts jobs that are already at risk more seriously and immediately at risk. Besides, the danger to the unskilled in higher-wage regions is not really new; the Rust Belt began forming because of North Carolina, not because of South Korea. Nor does America’s trade deficit indicate what anti-trade campaigners suppose. Douglas Irwin (my colleague at Dartmouth) writes in Foreign Affairs that the American economy is usually growing and creating jobs when the deficit grows, and it decreases when the economy is contracting. The deficit reflects, among other things, large capital flows from abroad, which sustain the dollar as a reserve currency; the deficit has remained roughly unchanged at about two to three per cent of G.D.P. over the past seven years. The jobs at Carrier in Indiana, which management is moving to Mexico—and Trump made much of, threatening tariffs on air-conditioners—have been more than made up for this year by jobs at Subaru and Honda plants in the state. “We understand that many of our citizens are frustrated by the pace of globalization and feel they’re not experiencing the benefits of international trade,” Obama said after the latest G-20 meeting, in Hangzhou, China; the challenge, he said, is to “spur economic growth, to boost free trade, and build a fairer economy that truly works for all.” How fairer? The answer cannot be working to unravel the global networks and trade flows that converge in a knowledge economy; the advisory firm Ocean Tomo estimated last year that eighty-seven per cent of the assets of S. \u0026 P. 500 corporations are now “intangible“: the management of science and technology, the chemistry of teams, network effects, cosmopolitan values. Fairness, rather, requires more government retraining programs, portable health care, cheaper community colleges, state investments in clean energy—in short, educating motivated workers and engendering lower-skilled jobs that cannot be exported. The most important of the latter will come from major infrastructure projects, like Boston’s “Big Dig,” which has been rashly vilified for its cost overruns and construction mistakes but eventually created thousands of well-paying, low-skill construction jobs, and ultimately joined the city’s Financial District to the Seaport area, catalyzing scores of billions in new building, tourism, and business development. George Gendron, the former editor of Inc. Magazine, told me that the new “innovation district” in the Seaport, once derelict, is, thanks to the Big Dig, the most expensive real estate in Boston. “General Electric is putting up its new global headquarters in the Seaport, which will be networking with dozens of startups from M.I.T. and Harvard,” he said. Sanders’s movement is calling for a trillion-dollar investment in this kind of infrastructure, supported by higher taxes on the wealthy; the Clinton campaign wants a little more than a quarter of a trillion, with no new taxes and an infrastructure bank. Trump, for his part, wants to spend “billions” along with a tax cut; his first major supporter, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, famously killed a new commuter-train tunnel from the Garden State to New York City. These differences might well have been the focus of campaign coverage, and might yet be raised in the final debate. It is a sad tribute to Ricardo that they are overshadowed by a simplified resentment for trade. “Blaming trade for the loss of manufacturing jobs is an easy mark, and misguided, something like blaming immigration,” Gendron said. “If somebody else is working, and you are not, that has to be stopped. There’s a better way, but it will cost us.”","description":"Bernard Avishai on American politicians’ anxiety over trade deals and the changes that have reshaped global corporations over the past generation.","keywords":"","time":1476738054,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-meaning-of-open-trade-and-open-borders?mbid=rss"},{"title":"The Real Soylent Sickness","body":"I have never tasted Soylent, the meal substitute dreamed up in Silicon Valley’s hacker-engineering culture and beloved by tech workers, but it hasn’t exactly received raves for flavor. Lizzie Widdicombe, writing about it in the magazine, two years ago, found a “yeasty, comforting blandness about it.” The tech team at Quartz came up with a list of descriptors including “wet cardboard,” “the aftertaste of Cheerios cereal,” and “not food.” Now that Soylent’s snack bars, the newest form for ingesting the food-replacement substance, have been voluntarily recalled by the company, after Gizmodo reported that the product made dozens of customers sick, that innocuous taste will likely be the least of its concerns. The source of the Soylent Bar sickness is still unknown, and, while foodborne illness is nothing new to packaged foods, the incident highlights a deeper problem with Silicon Valley’s mission to radically alter the way we eat. Over the past few years, as money from the tech industry has found its way into all sorts of disruptive startups, the can-do engineering culture has set its sights on our daily bread. Tech companies have promised substances to make life better for vegetarians, vegans, and those concerned about sustainability: eggless mayonnaise, fake meat, milk-free milk, and other lab-cultivated non-animal products that taste, smell, and even bleed like the real fleshy equivalents. And they’ve provided edible tools for the overworked drones of the tech industry: cubes of caffeine engineered to increase brainpower, without the coffee doldrums that follow, and, yes, Soylent, a liquid meal replacement for the nutrients you need to survive, without the inconvenience of eating actual food. The result, fuelled by hundreds of millions in venture-capital investments, is a budding industry of food futurism that blends the utopianism of Silicon Valley’s culture with the quackery of Dr. Oz-approved “superfoods” and the idea that you can live forever if you just eat enough pomegranate seeds. The problem with all this food-2.0 stuff isn’t that it sometimes tastes horrible but that it misses the mark on how our eating is evolving. The tech world approaches food from the perspective of engineering: a defined problem to be solved, with the right equations, formulas, compounds, and brainpower. Soylent was developed by its creator, Rob Rhinehart, to compress all the nutrition the human body needs to live into one single, easily digestible formula, like the twenty-first-century version of manna. But that is fundamentally the opposite of the way we increasingly want to eat in America and in much of the developed world. When you look at the recent arc of food culture, the most significant food movement is the purposeful pushback against the postwar industrial food system, a system that was the food futurism of its day. This industry brought us preservatives, Wonder Bread, Tang, and microwavable frozen TV dinners. It lowered the price of food tremendously and increased convenience in innumerable ways, but it also made us fatter and sicker, and robbed our meals of their original flavors,replacing them with addictive but unhealthy substances. As Michael Moss has written, food scientists, particularly in the realm of snack foods, figured out how to combine salt, sugar, and fat in a way to provide “maximum bliss.” In his recent book “The Dorito Effect,” the journalist Mark Schatzker details the persistent effect that progress in food processing has had on our taste buds, as we amp up artificial flavors in an attempt regain the natural flavor we have stripped from our food with technology. He argues that returning food to the most basic, unaltered form is the best solution not just for taste but health. Starting in the nineteen-seventies, the American food movement that began in the San Francisco Bay area and its international equivalents, such as Italy’s slow-food movement, saw the harm that this technologically centered food system did to taste, culture, health, and the environment. Instead, they proposed alternatives that were seen as archaic at the time, but which we increasingly accept as commonplace: organic produce and livestock, locally sourced products, and traditionally made food from whole ingredients. This movement grew for various reasons, despite the fact that the food it promoted was more expensive to produce and consume, and vastly more difficult to grow and cook than the conventional, highly processed equivalent. It spoke to people’s social consciousness. It required less fertilizer and chemicals. It provided a healthier alternative. It is easy to critique this as bourgeois, overpriced, and inaccessible to those who can’t afford a hobby of enlightened eating, but as the modern food movement has grown, so have the economies of scale that support it. You can now buy reasonably priced organic foods at many supermarkets across North America, and the number of farmers’ markets around the country has grown nearly tenfold in the past decade. Even the most heavily processed food brands, such as McDonald’s, pay lip service to better, less processed ingredients. What Soylent and the latest batch of food-tech startups are aiming for takes us back to the days of astronaut ice cream. Remember that stuff? It was developed as part of the space program in the nineteen-sixties, and you bought it in the sort of science stores that were toy stores for nerds. It was sweet. It came in ice-cream flavors. But it wasn’t ice cream, it was a simulation of ice cream, and no one in their right mind would chose it over the cold, creamy stuff on a hot day. Not even an astronaut. Silicon Valley’s failure to capture our appetites lies at the heart of what the technology industry misses about so many other things in this world. Though it may be possible to create technically feasible products for any aspect of our lives, those only succeed if they improve—rather than seek to replace—the human, highly tactile, and pleasurable world we want to live in. Most humans are happy to eat real food, and crave it in its most natural form. A strawberry picked at the height of summer. Fish pulled from a river and grilled over wood coals. Sourdough bread made from a twenty-year-old starter, and kneaded by hand. Wine grown on knobby vines, and aged in a dark cellar. Why would you disrupt that?","description":"David Sax on the recent recall of Soylent Bars, and what Soylent and other food-tech startups miss about the American approach to food.","keywords":"","time":1476712851,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-real-soylent-sickness?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Twitter Has Never Been Stronger—or Weaker","body":"If you listen to the financial news, and the financial markets, Twitter is floundering. The company is actively shopping itself to deep-pocketed buyers in hopes of ending the cycle of raised expectations and dashed hopes that has characterized its relationship with Wall Street. But a number of those potential buyers, including Disney and Microsoft, have already passed, and Salesforce.com just told the Financial Times, “We’ve walked away.” The uncertainty about Twitter’s future has made the company’s share price as volatile over the past couple of weeks as a penny stock’s, and has raised questions about the company’s future if no sale materializes. If you use, or even scan, Twitter, though, the service seems as strong, and as influential, as ever. The past week alone has seen typically sharp commentary on Sunday night’s Presidential debate and a series of typically nutty, and newsmaking, tweets from Donald Trump. (Twitter was even a point of discussion in the debate itself, when Trump responded to a question about a middle-of-the-night tweet attack with a rambling answer that ended with this undeniable statement: “Tweeting happens to be a modern-day form of communication. . . . It’s a very effective form of communication.”) More important, last weekend, after the tape of Trump bragging about groping women was released, hundreds of thousands of women tweeted out personal stories of being molested and assaulted, using the hashtag #notokay. It was an extraordinary collective protest against the casual acceptance of sexual assault, as well as a testament to the social impact of Twitter at its best. That disjunction between, on the one hand, the market’s lack of faith in Twitter and, on the other, Twitter users’ profound engagement with the service, is really at the heart of what’s happened to the company in recent years. When Twitter went public, almost three years ago, it was a market darling: its stock nearly doubled in its first day of trading, and for a brief period Twitter’s market capitalization was actually larger than Facebook’s. But, in some ways, that was as good as it got for Twitter as a company. Though it has grown revenue to more than two billion dollars, has three hundred million active users and hundreds of millions of visitors, and is now a crucial medium for cultural and political discourse, Twitter has regularly disappointed investors. It has never turned a profit and has made a practice of missing earnings estimates. And though Twitter’s revenues, which come almost entirely from advertising, have been growing at a respectable clip, its user base is growing too slowly for Wall Street’s taste. Last summer, the former Twitter C.E.O Dick Costolo argued that the company’s problems were the result, in part, of pressure from Wall Street, which was forcing Twitter to pay more attention to its stock price than its underlying business. Those comments were dismissed by some as sour grapes. But in some important sense Costolo was right. Twitter, in fact, serves as an object lesson in the danger of becoming a public company too soon. The familiar rap on Wall Street pressure is that it forces companies into a short-term mentality, focussing more on the next ninety days than the future, and leading them away from investments that can build real value in the long run. This critique, as I’ve written about before, is overblown: companies today are valued based on what investors think they’ll do over the next ten to twenty years, and a company like Amazon, which didn’t make a profit until its ninth year, shows that, if you win investors’ trust, they are more than happy to let you invest for the long run. Nor is it obvious, in Twitter’s case, that the company has underinvested in the future—its R. \u0026 D. spending is reasonable for a company its size. And, in any case, Twitter is still valued at more than twelve billion dollars, which is quite impressive for an unprofitable company. Still, even if Wall Street pressure hasn’t led Twitter to neglect the future, it’s had a negative and often demoralizing impact on the firm. Realistically, Twitter never had any real hope of living up to the inflated expectations that greeted its I.P.O. But companies can’t tell investors that their expectations are unrealistic: once they go public, they have to try to fulfill them. Failing to live up to impossible expectations fostered the image of Twitter as a company that was always falling short. It led the company to spend more energy trying to monetize users rather than improving their experiences. And Twitter’s tumbling share price (it’s now down more than sixty per cent since its first day of trading) has served as a constant negative public referendum on its prospects, which has eaten away at its employees’ morale, a problem compounded by the fact that Twitter relies so heavily on stock-based compensation to pay its workers. This doesn’t excuse Twitter’s leaders for the questionable choices they’ve made over the years. The company’s done a notoriously poor job of dealing with harassment and hate speech on its service. It has taken it surprisingly long to do away with rules that seem designed to annoy users, like counting links and user names against the hundred-and-forty-character limit. In a well-known public letter last year, the investor Chris Sacca made a strong case that Twitter needed to do a much better job of making the service more welcoming and user-friendly as a way of broadening its reach beyond its hard-core base. As Sacca pointed out, millions of users create Twitter accounts and then quickly abandon them. Changing that would assuage Wall Street’s concerns about the slow growth of the user base, and would meaningfully increase the company’s ad revenue. Yet it’s important to see that even these critiques of Twitter, sensible as they may be, are predicated on the idea that the proper goal for the company is to grow ever bigger. It’s a way of criticizing Twitter for not being Facebook or Google. But the truth is that not every company needs to be—or should be—huge. Nor is growth the only, or even the most important, metric by which to judge a company. Indeed, if you look at Twitter in terms of social impact and user engagement, you would say that the company is doing quite well and adding a great deal of value. The problem is that, for a publicly traded company, that value is irrelevant if it can’t be translated into continually rising profits. Going public pushes you to define yourself in the market’s terms rather than your own. As a private company, Twitter might be seen as a great success. As a public company, it’s a perpetual disappointment.","description":"James Surowiecki writes about Twitter’s success as a communications tool and its failure as a publicly-traded company on Wall Street.","keywords":"","time":1476451420,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/twitter-has-never-been-stronger-or-weaker?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Trump’s Muse on U.S. Trade with China","body":"Economics has been a crutch for some Republicans who want to convince themselves that, of two hated candidates, Donald Trump is the one who shares most of their values. He doesn’t like taxes—boy, does he not like taxes—and he doesn’t like regulation, so we’ll let his hatred of trade slide. But his hatred of trade, unlike his more perfunctory economic pronouncements, is enthusiastic. At the Presidential debate on Sunday night, when asked a vague question about caring for all Americans, he went straight to his comfortable place: “When I look at . . . the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential.” What is preventing that potential from being realized? “Trade, where we’re doing so badly. . . . It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable.” Trade has played a central role in Trump’s campaign. It is his most consistently expressed explanation for America’s failings, and reducing imports and increasing exports is one of his primary policy solutions to Make America Great Again. While most Americans, and nearly all economists, believe that trade has, on balance, been good for America (if not for all Americans), Trump has found deep support from people who are feeling economic pain. Trump’s views on trade are crude: there are winners (them) and losers (us), and there is one simple solution that will fix everything (threat of a trade war). How Trump came to these views is not totally clear, but his thinking, especially on trade and China, has certainly been influenced by Peter Navarro, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of California, Irvine. Being the only economist—and one with a Harvard Ph.D. at that—on Donald Trump’s economic team, Navarro provides a patina of legitimacy. (The others on Trump’s economic team are businesspeople who donated to the campaign and several people from the far right of Republican economic thought.) Navarro’s views on trade and China are so radical, however, that, even with his assistance, I was unable to find another economist who fully agrees with them. Should Donald Trump overcome the odds against him now and be elected President, Navarro would likely become the single most powerful economic adviser in the United States. Navarro, a sixty-seven-year-old who has the silver hair and resonant voice of a veteran senator, was hired at the University of California, Irvine’s Paul Merage School of Business in 1989 largely because of research he had done on public utilities. Soon after moving to California, he began a decade-long pursuit of elected office. He ran as a Democrat in a number of races, including for mayor of San Diego and for Congress, which he didn’t win. In the next phase of his life, Navarro sought to enter the public conversation in another way, as the author of popular economics books. In 2001, he published “If It’s Raining in Brazil, Buy Starbucks: The Investor’s Guide to Profiting from News and Other Market-Moving Events,” the first of a series of get-rich investing books. Then, in 2006, Navarro’s work dramatically shifted. He published the first of three books for general audiences and policymakers that take a hard-line, antagonistic view of China. He wrote “The Coming China Wars: Where They Will Be Fought, How They Can Be Won,” a short, zippy attack on China for pretty much everything—intellectual-property theft, pollution, prison labor. His follow-up books, “Death by China: Confronting the Dragon—A Global Call to Action” and “Crouching Tiger: What China’s Militarism Means for the World,” were accompanied by films directed by Navarro. “Death by China” did show in theatres and received dismissive reviews, including one that called it “the documentary equivalent of a raving street-corner derelict.” One viewer, though, loved it. The film’s marketing materials include a blurb by Donald Trump: “ ‘Death by China’ is right on. This important documentary depicts our problem with China with facts, figures and insight. I urge you to see it.” Navarro first came into contact with Trump in 2011, after reading that Trump told the official Chinese government news agency, Xinhua, that Navarro’s first book on China was one of his favorites. The two men communicated occasionally after that, but only met in person during the Presidential campaign. Navarro told me he has spent much more time with the candidate lately, sometimes joining the small circle of advisers invited on his plane. Navarro’s view on China—a view he shares with Trump—is not simply that China engages in unfair trade practices. That is common knowledge. China does manipulate its currency. China also does ignore intellectual-property laws, has a poor record of worker-safety standards and environmental protection, and, in many other ways, has improved its ability to compete in the global economy at the expense of other nations. But Navarro takes these commonly held views into radical terrain. He argues that China and its bad practices are the world’s central problem. “Until the trade issue is fixed, there can be no prosperity in the global economy,” he wrote me in an e-mail. In another, he criticized other economists, saying that they “assume countries don’t cheat and exchange rates float. That’s even stupider [in] a real world which proves just the opposite. Once cheating occurs and/or there is currency manipulation, trade becomes a zero sum game with winners like China and Mexico and losers like the US.” The phrase “zero-sum game” is a powerful one in economics; it refers to a situation in which one party to a transaction can only gain if the other party loses. This is in contrast to most other market transactions, in which both parties can be made better off by exchanging with each other. For Navarro, the U.S. is a loser—a passive victim, whose prosperity is in the hands of the leadership of China and Mexico. His solution, much like Trump’s, is for the U.S. to threaten to impose a massive tariff on all Chinese imports. Navarro calculated a tariff of forty-three per cent; Trump has suggested forty-five per cent. (Navarro told me he isn’t sure if Trump took the number from him or if they came to their figures independently.) Navarro argues that the mere threat of this tariff will so terrify China that the country will change its policies and will export far less to the United States. “American multinationals will onshore their new factories,” he wrote, moving them from China, Vietnam, and Mexico “to cities like Charleston, Detroit, Houston, Oklahoma City, Savannah, Youngstown and Toledo.” This is an appealing fantasy for some. But Navarro’s view is not just simplistic, it is wrong and dangerous. There’s no reason to think China would acquiesce to Trump’s threats; doing so would all but guarantee that China would face an unending series of similar threats from America and others. Instead, it would most likely respond with tariffs of its own, shutting down American imports. China already trades more with the European Union than it does with the U.S., and would shift its trading strategy even more decisively away from us. It is hard to find a major American exporter who doesn’t see China as its most promising area of growth. A trade war would shatter General Motors, all of Hollywood, the music industry, Boeing, and the entire state of Washington, which exports more goods to China than any other. Navarro and Trump also assume a manufacturing universe that no longer exists. American manufacturers have shifted away from making lower-cost commodity goods and focus, instead, on more expensive, complex products, like medical devices, automobiles, and airplanes. All of those goods require a steady input of smaller, commodity components like screws and circuit boards that are made in China and other countries. Some companies might react by beginning to manufacture those lower-cost commodity products domestically, but it seems unlikely that many manufacturers would do so. A huge tariff on China wouldn’t suddenly force Vietnam or Mexico or, for that matter, Germany or Japan to reduce their global competitiveness. Indeed, they would see it as an opportunity. Multinational corporations considering leaving China would face an easy choice: they could reinvest in the U.S., in the midst of a unilaterally created trade war, or they could invest in any other country on earth and have access to the U.S. and global markets. These are just the easily predicted first-order effects of a massive tariff increase on all Chinese imports. There are many terrifying second-order impacts. Trump and Navarro focus on America’s manufacturing-trade deficit. But the global economy has also brought the U.S. a tremendous investment surplus. Foreign governments, companies, and citizens spend much of their savings on U.S. government bonds and the stock of American companies. While this investment has not always led to benign outcomes (the financial crisis of the previous decade was, in part, caused by all that cash from all over the world seeking returns in the U.S.), shutting down global trade would, necessarily, also shut down this investment. Interest rates would skyrocket, and the U.S. would enter a painful recession, possibly a depression. It has been an awful few decades for manufacturing workers and for many others, especially those with less education. While a good chunk of the blame should fall on our dramatic increase in trade with China, other onslaughts have contributed greatly. Workers have been displaced by technology and discouraged from getting more education because of the rising cost of public universities. Democratically aligned economists point to weaker unions, a low minimum wage, a lack of infrastructure spending, and a series of congressional and Supreme Court actions that shift bargaining power away from workers and toward corporations. Many traditional Republicans believe that regulations and taxes prevent investment that could lead to more jobs. There is enormous disagreement about the proper response to global trade. However, pretty much every economics scholar would observe that the United States is hardly powerless against China and that the fundamental solutions to adjusting to a global economy are domestic ones. We have, within the United States, all the power we need to improve our education system, to help workers transfer to more promising industries, to invest in infrastructure, and to improve worker bargaining power. The first hint of how Navarro’s ideas might play out in a Trump Administration came in the most comprehensive economic document so far released by the campaign. Navarro, along with the Trump supporter and private-equity investor Wilbur Ross, wrote “Scoring the Trump Economic Plan: Trade, Regulatory, \u0026 Energy Policy Impacts.” The core purpose of the document was to counter the nonpartisan Tax Foundation’s grim assessment of Trump’s tax-cut policies. The Tax Foundation, like many other independent observers, believes that Trump’s financial plans would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt. Navarro and Ross counter that if the U.S. were to eliminate the trade deficit there would be so many new jobs, with so many of those new workers paying taxes, that Trump’s tax cuts would be nearly revenue-neutral. The document, which has been mocked on the left and the right, presents no concrete prescription to correct the trade imbalance it abhors. One key sentence: “Trump proposes eliminating America’s $500 billion trade deficit through a combination of increased exports and reduced imports.” This is a tautology, equivalent to saying one plans to weigh less in the future through a combination of losing weight and not gaining weight. The paper does list a familiar series of problems with U.S.-China trade, such as currency manipulation and bad trade deals, and asserts that Trump will correct these without any clarification as to how he will do it. Greg Mankiw, an economist at Harvard who was an adviser to President George W. Bush and to Mitt Romney’s 2012 campaign, called the analysis “truly disappointing” and wrote on his blog that it missed things that “even a freshman at the end of ec 10 knows.” Navarro’s responses to critiques tend to be blistering and Trumpian. In an e-mail describing economists who disagree with him about trade, he used the words “stupid” and “stupider” to characterize their views. The next morning, when I asked for clarification, he wrote, “This is why I don’t trust you or want to discuss anything on the phone with you. Where did you come up with the ‘stupid’ thing? Were you recording me on our phone call without my permission?” (In the interest of full disclosure, Navarro did take me to task in The National Interest for not being objective on Trump in an earlier story. Also, I didn’t record him.) Nearly all economists would agree that trade with China has caused pain for many American workers and needs attention. Some left-leaning economists, like Dean Baker, are especially frustrated with U.S. trade policy that has, they argue, favored the interests of large corporations over working people. But I have never heard any public-policy expert make claims like Navarro’s: that trade is the central problem in the world, that trade brings mostly pain to America, and that dramatically lessening trade will bring a renaissance to our economy. I asked Navarro to refer me to economists who agree with him on trade issues. He told me to talk with Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland, and Alan Tonelson, a blogger who writes frequently against trade. “Tonelson is a fine economist,” Navarro wrote. That e-mail was quickly followed by one from Tonelson himself, acknowledging “that I do not hold an economics degree.” I then spoke at length with Morici, who said that he agrees with Navarro that there are deep problems with our trade relationship with China, but that Navarro “has a rather severe position. That zero-sum statement, I have a problem with that. Where’s his proof?” Donald Trump’s other leading economic adviser, the libertarian activist Stephen Moore, told me that he does not completely agree with Navarro or Trump on trade issues. “I told him that in my first meeting: ‘Donald, I’m a free-trade guy.’ He said, ‘O.K., help me with other things.’ ” Navarro is the only Ph.D. economist I was able to find who enthusiastically supports Trump. I can’t say there aren’t any others, but, in weeks of reporting, I have not been able to find any. As a likely place to start, I used a letter that three hundred and five economists wrote expressing their concerns about Hillary Clinton’s economic policies. The letter was, pointedly, not an endorsement of Donald Trump, though Moore did tell me he helped craft it. I reached out to dozens of the economists who signed the letter. Most had responses like Lloyd Cohen, of George Mason University: “These are two of the most unattractive human beings one could possibly imagine running for President.” Howard Baetjer, Jr., of Towson University, wrote, “No! I don’t endorse Trump! That’s dreadful to contemplate. No, I especially deplore his ignorant, inhumane, and economically damaging immigration and trade policies.” A handful said they might vote for Trump as the lesser of two evils. To be fair, I did not reach every letter signer, nor did I contact every economist in the United States. However, even in this select group of anti-Clinton economist partisans, the percentage who express enthusiastic support for Trump is shockingly small. The number may turn out to be no more than one: Peter Navarro.","description":"Adam Davidson on Peter Navarro, the Harvard-trained economist who is serving as Donald Trump’s economic adviser and shares Trump’s view on trade with China.","keywords":"","time":1476293408,"url":"http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/trumps-muse-on-u-s-trade-with-china?mbid=rss"},{"title":"Snapchat Ready To Make A Lasting Mark?","body":"Amazon for the first time has filed lawsuits against counterfeit sellers, after a number of businesses voiced concern that knockoffs were killing their sales and endangering consumers.

EU antitrust regulators are set to fine HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Credit Agricole (OTCPK:CRARY) by the end of the year for rigging financial benchmarks linked to the euro, Reuters reports. Charges were levied in May 2014 against the three banks, which denied wrongdoing. Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), RBS and Societe Generale (OTCPK:SCGLY) admitted guilt in December 2013, while Barclays (NYSE:BCS) avoided a fine because it alerted the European Commission. Despite years of delays, the SEC has finally approved a plan to introduce a vast surveillance system to oversee trading on the $23T U.S. stock market, in response to the 2010 \"Flash Crash.\" The creation of a Consolidated Audit Trail will establish a regulatory central database and monitor every trade order, execution, modification and cancellation in real-time. Boeing will cut 500 jobs over four years and shut two plants as it revamps its defense and space unit. The company also said it would create a new global operations group that would include its defense units in Australia, Saudi Arabia, and U.K. Boeing's (NYSE:BA) defense, space and security business accounted for 31.4% of the planemaker's total revenue of $23.9B in the latest quarter. During his campaign Donald Trump singled out Ford (NYSE:F) by name, calling on the American car manufacturer to stop sending jobs to Mexico and threatening to slap tariffs on any cars imported from south of the border. However, CEO Mark Fields still intends to move forward small car production to Mexico, but plans to work openly with the new president and Congress. \"Two very important products will continue to be produced in U.S. factories,\" he said at the Los Angeles Auto Show. Although a press release was published a few days ago, news outlets are now reporting that AT\u0026T (NYSE:T) will collaborate with NASA to develop an Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management program to allow agencies to monitor drones. The solution will make it safer for drone operators to plan and monitor flight paths, navigate UAVs, use drones for surveillance and will likely reduce the threat of cyberattacks. Boom! Honeywell (NYSE:HON) has agreed to supply avionics for a proposed supersonic jetliner - intended to carry only premium passengers - that could cruise 10% faster than the now extinct Concorde. The demonstrator vehicle, called Baby Boom, is slated to take to the air in 2017. If development goes as planned, the full-size version, including engines manufactured by General Electric (NYSE:GE), could start carrying passengers as early as next decade.","description":"The clock has started ticking for one of the most eagerly awaited market debuts of 2017.

While recent gains are largely being attributed to the market getting more comfortable with his style and proposed policies, year-end rallies are common in most election years, with the Dow gaining 1.8%, on average, from Election Day thru Dec. 31. Economy Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has emerged as the favorite to serve as Secretary of State in Trump's incoming administration. An official said there was no real competition for the job and that it was Giuliani's if he wanted it, but another source cautioned that John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, remains in contention for the position. Central bankers weigh in on Trumponomics... Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker: Trump's plans to ramp up infrastructure spending could boost fiscal stimulus, prompting the Fed to raise rates. Dallas's Robert Kaplan: Trump should enact 'intelligent' fiscal policy to increase growth. San Francisco's John Williams: U.S. should maintain its commitment to free trade and open policies. SEC Chairman Mary Jo White plans to step down around the same time President Obama exits the Oval Office, opening the door to a new Republican-appointed leader who could move to loosen rules on Wall Street. Those could include rolling back curbs required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, relaxing mutual funds' use of derivatives, and limiting controls on algorithmic traders and dark pools. Looking to \"normalize U.S.-Russia ties,\" President-elect Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone on Monday and agreed to work towards \"constructive cooperation\" and \"combine efforts to tackle international terrorism.\" Meanwhile, Russia's economy minister has been detained over an alleged bribe relating to a mega domestic deal between two of the country's biggest oil companies - Rosneft (OTC:RNFTF) and Bashneft. The greenback continues to gain strength on expectations of higher interest rates under Trump, pushing the yuan to a near 8-year low and taking its losses so far this year to more than 5%. The People's Bank of China set its daily fix at 6.8495 yuan against the dollar, compared with Monday's 6.8291 yuan, marking the weakest fix for the currency since 2008. The decision to withdraw 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes in India as an \"anti-corruption drive\" may have been applauded by many across the country, but low-income earners, tourists and those dependent on ordinary cash have been bearing the brunt of the new policy. \"There have been massive lines outside banks to deposit cash, endless queues outside the ATM machines and these machines have run out of cash,\" Delhi-resident Sarita Das told CNBC. GDP grew 0.3% in the eurozone in Q3, or 1.6% on an annual basis, according to official figures. Last week, the European Commission cut its GDP forecasts for the bloc on increased political uncertainty and weaker global trade. The EU expects the euro area to grow 1.7% this year and 1.5% in 2017, after climbing 2% in 2015. U.K. inflation for October unexpectedly slowed to 0.9% on-year, driven down by the price of clothing and university tuition fees. The figures come as BoE Governor Mark Carney prepares to testify to lawmakers about the outlook for inflation. Officials earlier this month dropped plans to cut interest rates again and shifted to a neutral policy stance, saying their tolerance for faster price gains was limited. Britain has no overall plan for Brexit and the strategy for leaving the EU might not be agreed for six months due to divisions in Theresa May's government, according to a leaked memo seen by BBC and The Times. The document, prepared for the Cabinet Office by a consultant, said government departments were discussing more than 500 Brexit-related projects and might require an additional 30K civil servants to cope with the immense workload. Stocks Warren Buffett has taken an unexpected stake in four major U.S. airlines. According to regulatory filings, his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) invested $1.2B in American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta (NYSE:DAL), United Continental (NYSE:UAL) and Southwest (NYSE:LUV). The Sage of Omaha did not share his rationale behind the trades, but he has long been bearish on the sector. In 2013 he described the industry as a \"death trap\". Activist investors haven't gone away. They're just thinking smaller. Activists this year through October have launched just 14 campaigns at firms worth more than $10B, down from 26 over the same period last year, according to FactSet. However, they started campaigns at 202 companies worth less than $1B, just behind last year's record pace of 213. Many multinationals sold their Venezuelan operations at hefty discounts earlier this year - or even gave them away - seeking to escape the nation's soaring inflation and chronic supply shortages. Six firms, including General Mills (NYSE:GIS) and Harvest Natural Resources (NYSE:HNR), offloaded their operations for as little as half their assessed value, while Clorox (NYSE:CLX) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) chose to abandon their local operations.

Vodafone +2% premarket after investors cheered its European organic growth in H1 and full-year goals despite the mobile operator reporting a sharply wider net loss. As a result of a €5B write-down on its Indian business - due to cutthroat competition in the populous country - Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) will not launch the unit's highly anticipated IPO before March next year. \"We are not Ericsson, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) is in crisis\" warned rival Nokia (NYSE:NOK), however, its own shares hit a 3-year low as it projected a 2% decline in its network market next year.

It's also planning to slightly increase its dividend. NOK -4.2% premarket. With the U.S. election finally over, is America ready for some football? In a season marked by across-the-board ratings declines, Fox's (NASDAQ:FOX) broadcast of Sunday's Cowboys-Steelers game drew the highest rating of any NFL game this season - a 17.8 overnight rating.

Rejecting diesel cheating claims, Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) and Cummins (NYSE:CMI) said they will fight a class-action lawsuit filed against them on Monday. Lawyers representing owners of older 2500 and 3500 Dodge Ram trucks assert the companies \"conspired to knowingly deceive consumers and regulators of illegally high levels of diesel emissions in their vehicles.\" FCAU +5.2% premarket. Jaguar Land Rover is jumping on the electric SUV bandwagon. Jaguar (NYSE:TTM) plans to deliver its I-Pace vehicle in 2018, with other luxury carmakers close behind.

Hours after Google announced it would ban sites that peddle fake news stories from using its advertising network, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has followed suit. The social network is adding fake news sites to the list of sources already barred from using its Facebook Audience Network ads - a directory that previously included misleading, illegal, and deceptive sites. Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) policy changes will affect its AdSense advertising network. WhatsApp is finally launching video calling for all of its one billion users (the service will be fully encrypted). It's pretty simple - one just clicks the call icon to make a voice call then selects \"video call\" to activate it. A major plus point of WhatsApp's (FB) video calling is cross-platform support, unlike FaceTime, which only works with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices, and Google Duo (GOOG, GOOGL), which isn't compatible with older versions of iOS. iGlasses? Apple is considering expanding into wearable glass headsets and has talked about the project with potential suppliers. While still in an exploration phase, the device would connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision, and may use augmented reality, Bloomberg reports. Should Apple (AAPL) ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest. Today's Markets In Asia, Japan flat at 17668. Hong Kong +0.5% to 22323.

The outlook for global sovereign ratings is negative possibly until 2018 amid expectations for low economic growth and high public-sector debt, according to Moody's Investors Service. Around 26%, or 35 out of 134 sovereigns, currently have a negative outlook, marking the largest proportion since late 2012. The news comes as a two-day thumping wipes out more than $1T across bond markets worldwide. Japan's economic growth handily beat expectations in the July-September period, expanding for a third straight quarter as exports recovered, but weak domestic activity cast doubt on hopes for a sustainable recovery. While GDP grew at an annualized 2.2% pace, household spending and capital investment were flat on quarter, despite efforts by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to get companies to spend more of their cash. Mixed Chinese economic data for October came out overnight, released by the National Bureau of Statistics. Retail sales rose a weaker-than-expected 10%, slowing from the previous month's 10.7% growth, while industrial output expanded 6.1%, matching September's pace but remaining a hair below expectations. Meanwhile, fixed-asset investment climbed by 8.3% in the January-October period, in-line with estimates. A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake pummeled central New Zealand early Monday, killing at least two people, damaging roads and buildings and setting off hundreds of strong aftershocks. \"It's just utter devastation, I just don't know... that's months of work,\" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key declared. \"It's hard to believe that the bill is going to be less than a couple of billion.\" South Korean prosecutors have questioned the heads of some large conglomerates, including the chairman of Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMLF), and plan to question the de factor head of Samsung Group in a probe over a political scandal involving President Park Geun-hye, according to Yonhap News Agency. Pressure is mounting on Park to step down after hundreds of thousands of demonstrators marched in the capital on Saturday to protest allegations that she let a friend meddle in state affairs. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi may not stay on if his referendum on constitutional reform - that would reduce the role of the upper house Senate and cut the powers of regional governments - fails on Dec. 4. \"If I have to stay on in parliament and do what everyone else has done before me, that is, to scrape by and just float there, that does not suit me,\" he said in a radio interview. After gathering in Brussels to discuss the future of Europe-U.S. relations, EU foreign ministers said the bloc would stand by its key foreign-policy positions on issues including the Iran deal, Russia's annexation of Crimea and climate change, but vowed to work with the Trump administration. Not everyone attended the emergency meeting. Britain's Boris Johnson called it \"unnecessary,\" Hungary's Peter Szijjarto called it \"hysterical\" and France's Jean-Marc Ayrault blamed scheduling issues for his absence. Colombia's government and Marxist FARC rebels have agreed on a new peace pact to end a 52-year war, six weeks after the original was narrowly rejected in a referendum amid objections it was too favorable to the rebels. The new accord, which will be presented to Congress for a vote, includes several new provisions - from requiring FARC to surrender money and holdings to infrastructure development for the countryside.","description":"U.S. bond yields are sharply higher across the board following a public market holiday on Friday, as traders continue to eye upward inflation trends following","keywords":"","time":1479125141,"url":"http://seekingalpha.com/article/4023016-wall-street-breakfast-bond-market-rout-intensifies?source=feed_tag_wall_st_breakfast"},{"title":"Alibaba Can't Find Its Match","body":"Disney said it expects modest earnings growth next year and an even more robust rise in 2018, sending the stock up in after-hours trade after an initial fall.

New deals with Hulu and AT\u0026T/DirecTV (NYSE:T) could also help Disney (NYSE:DIS) attract elusive millennial customers. Allianz beat expectations in the third quarter, posting a 37% rise in net profit to €1.86B. Europe's largest insurer saw improvements across all its businesses, including bond fund manager Pimco, which logged net inflows for the first time in three years. Quarterly operating profit also beat forecasts, rising 18% and helping Allianz (OTCQX:AZSEY) reaffirm its full-year target. Wells Fargo is changing the way it handles whistleblower complaints following allegations it retaliated against employees who called an ethics hotline to report sales abuses. CEO Tim Sloan announced the change at a gathering of about 2,000 employees in Des Moines, Iowa, as part of a \"conversations tour\" he and other Wells (NYSE:WFC) executives are making to try and restore employee morale after the bank's recent scandal. CME Group CEO Phupinder Gill will retire at the end of the year, according to a statement issued by the world's largest futures market operator, with executive chairman Terry Duffy taking on his role after he leaves.

Saying it was too easy to spend their parents' money, Seattle District Judge John Coughenour has set up a year-long process to reimburse customers whose children made Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in-app purchases without permission, but rejected an FTC request for a $26.5M lump sum payout. The agency already settled similar cases against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). All three companies now require a password for in-app purchases or an opt-in to enable purchases without a code. \"I was never a great proponent of the split of the two companies,\" said Shari Redstone, vice chair of the board at CBS and Viacom (VIA, VIAB). \"Scale will matter to your advertisers, who more than ever have to reach the consumer on a number of platforms.\" A decade ago, Sumner Redstone decided to divide the two into separate companies, and while CBS has thrived, Viacom has wrestled with falling ratings and declining ad sales. The FCC has sent a letter to AT\u0026T (T) to express concerns over the company's practice of exempting its own streaming video services from data usage caps for its wireless customers and demanded answers by Nov. 21. AT\u0026T began the practice known as \"zero rating\" with the DirecTV video app in September and plans to do the same for its over-the-top service DirecTV Now when it launches later this month. Valeant may change its name to help boost its reputation, board member Bill Ackman told CNBC. A number of names are being considered, including the well-known moniker of its largest business, eyecare specialist Bausch \u0026 Lomb. That would be the latest effort by Valeant (NYSE:VRX) to break from its past after hiring a new CEO, overhauling its board and exploring billions of dollars in asset sales to pay down over $30B in debt. \"Fitbit has not received any communication from ABM Capital, or any other firm, regarding a reported offer,\" the fitness tracker maker said in a statement following a fishy SEC filing that suggested $12.50 per share buyout. However, the phone number of the Shanghai-based firm appears to have been disconnected. Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) shares took a roller coaster ride yesterday on the news.

Snap is selling its new futuristic, video-capturing sunglasses in true Snapchat fashion. Buyers can only purchase Spectacles from bright yellow vending machines called \"Snapbots\" that will travel around the country selling the $130 device. The catch?

The broad move higher in stocks is continuing across the globe today, though the speed of the reversal is leaving some market watchers scratching their heads. Economy Standard \u0026 Poor's has given the all-clear to America's credit rating, affirming it at 'AA+' with a stable outlook. \"We assume the longstanding institutional strengths and robust checks and balances of the U.S. will support policy execution in a Trump administration, despite the president-elect's lack of experience in public office,\" the ratings agency said. Moody's announced in September the election wouldn't impact its 'AAA' rating for the U.S. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered interest rates overnight, becoming the first central bank to respond to market volatility in the wake of Donald Trump's U.S. election win. \"Numerous uncertainties remain, particularly in respect of the international outlook,\" RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said. The bank cut its overnight cash rate by 25 bps to a record low of 1.75%. Over the weeks and months ahead, markets will watch Fed Chair Janet Yellen and President-elect Donald Trump to see if she resigns, he asks her to resign or they find a way to coexist. While Yellen's term is officially up in February 2018, about 16 months away, many administrations have worked in one way or another to oust a Fed chairman. Donald Trump is scheduled to meet Barack Obama at the White House this morning to discuss the transition of power. Trump will then meet with Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Speaker Paul Ryan to discuss how they can hit the ground running in a Trump administration. That meeting will take place in the afternoon at the Capitol Hill Club. China will seek support for a Beijing-led Asia-Pacific free trade area at a regional summit in Peru later this month after Trump's election win dashed the likelihood of a U.S.-led free trade pact. Obama had framed TPP, which excluded China, as an effort to write Asia's trade rules before Beijing could, while Trump has taken a more protectionist stance on trade issues, labeling the pact a \"disaster.\" While Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu reiterated that Mexico will not pay for Trump's proposed border wall, President Enrique Pena Nieto did call to congratulate him and agreed to meet before he takes office. As Trump strode toward victory, the peso plunged 13% to lifetime lows, but officials held back from taking action to support the currency. Egypt has secured $2B in financing from international banks, a day before the IMF's board meets to consider a $12B loan officials say will help restore investor confidence in the economy. The central bank said the repurchase transaction with overseas banks has a maturity of one year, with the funding provided against newly issued dollar-denominated sovereign bonds. The oil market risks running another surplus in 2017 without an output cut from OPEC, according to the IEA's monthly oil market report, which warned of \"another year of relentless global supply growth similar to that seen in 2016.\" Global supply rose by 800K barrels per day in October to 97.8M bpd, led by record OPEC production and rising output from non-OPEC members like Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan. Stocks Pfizer is evaluating a potential sale or spinoff of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14B, Reuters reports.

PFE +1.5% premarket. More spinoffs? Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) is planning a public listing of its $15B healthcare business to refocus on its core strengths of electrification, automation and digitization. The German group announced the move as it reported fourth-quarter profits that comfortably beat expectations, but issued a cautious outlook for the current fiscal year as orders dropped amid geopolitical uncertainty. Hanjin Shipping has drawn two final bids for the assets of its Asia-U.S. route and its stake in a California terminal, as the beleaguered company is broken up as part of a restructuring plan. A judge at the Seoul Central District Court, which is handling Hanjin's (OTC:HNJSF) insolvency proceedings, said the court planned to choose a preferred buyer by Monday and sign a formal contract by Nov. 21. There's a new Goldman Sachs partner class. The bank has elevated 84 employees to the coveted rank, bringing the total number of partners to around 484, or 1.4% of Goldman's (NYSE:GS) work force. Partners, a title that remains among the most prestigious on Wall Street, typically receive a $950,000 salary, a cut of a special bonus pool and the opportunity to invest in private funds. Goldman is also considering shifting some of its assets and operations from London to Frankfurt, according to Reuters, as it tries to secure access to the EU market when Britain leaves the bloc. Coming under the ECB's jurisdiction should allow it to continue selling its services to clients across the eurozone and wider EU post-Brexit. GS +1.1% premarket. Navinder Sarao, the British financial trader accused of causing the 2010 \"Flash Crash,\" has become the second person convicted of criminally spoofing after pleading guilty in a Chicago court.

The GOP also kept control of both the Senate and the House, giving the party greater freedom to implement its policy platform. Economy It's an historic day for the United States, but it may not be one for the markets. Global equities initially cratered on word of a Trump presidency, even triggering safety breakers on U.S. index futures, but have pared losses. Dow futures are now about 400 points lower, while the S\u0026P and Nasdaq are down over 2%. The tone is certainly negative, but this is not a Brexit reaction. As vote counting went on, there were some large currency moves. The Mexican peso was hit hardest, tumbling as much as 13%, while the U.S. dollar plunged against the euro, yen and Swiss franc. Mexico's central bank is scheduled to hold a joint news conference with the finance ministry at 8 a.m. this morning. Out of the dollar and out of stocks, but out of bonds? A bid for safety is apparent in the gold trade, however, a concurrent selloff has been happening in U.S. Treasuries, which are also typically seen as a safe haven asset. Are investors betting on more Treasuries coming to market under a Trump presidency? 10-year Treasury yield +7 bps to 1.93%. For OPEC to try and rein in production was always going to be a tough task but will a Trump victory make the job more difficult? A rapprochement with Russia could mean the lifting of Treasury sanctions on the Kremlin, but his opposition to the Iranian nuclear deal could curb investment in the Islamic Republic's energy sector. Crude futures flat at $45/bbl. Voters in Arizona, Colorado and Maine approved boosting the minimum wage in their states to $12 per hour (after a series of graduated increases), while the state of Washington approved increasing its minimum wage to $13.50 by 2020. The federal minimum wage remains $7.25, which has not been changed since 2009, but voters are demanding more and taking it to the ballot box. While there's no deja Brexit, there is new drama in the U.K. Scotland's government plans to join a challenge to Prime Minister Theresa May's push to begin the withdrawal from the EU without parliamentary consent. Nicola Sturgeon, first minister in Scotland's semiautonomous government in Edinburgh, has instructed the country's top law officer to apply to take part in a Supreme Court hearing scheduled to begin on Dec. 5. In a surprise move, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country is taking all existing 500 and 1,000 rupee notes out of circulation to curb corruption, thwart counterfeiters and dredge up what could be billions of dollars of taxable income currently stashed in the underground economy. The current 500- and 1,000-rupee bills will ceased being legal tender, but can be redeemed at banks and post offices until Dec. 30. Stocks Donald Trump's victory sets the stage for a series of radical policy reversals both at home and abroad. Banks: The core assumption the Fed will raise interest rates soon and follow with further gradual hikes over coming years will be called into question. Financial institutions are struggling on the news. Fed Funds futures are now pricing in less than a 50% chance of a December move and the ECB is likely to interpret the uncertainty with stimulus and lower rates for longer.

As of early Wednesday, races were still too close to call in Maine, which also had a recreational measure on the ballot. Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, paving the way for Oregon, and Alaska and Washington D.C. to follow suit. Californians have agreed to significantly raise the tax on cigarettes and vaping devices, but similar measures fell short in Colorado, North Dakota and Missouri. California's Proposition 56 will increase taxes on a pack of cigarettes from 87 cents to $2.87, bringing it more in line with other states, and sets a tax on e-cigarettes.

As it prepares for its second bankruptcy in as many years, American Apparel (OTCPK:APPCQ) has resumed sale talks with Sequential Brands (NASDAQ:SQBG) and Riley Financial (NASDAQ:RILY) after negotiations with Authentic Brands stalled earlier this week. Declaring bankruptcy would allow any buyer of the Los Angeles company to avoid tens of millions of dollars in liabilities, including leases for around 140 stores in the U.S. and Canada. A Google drone might deliver your Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) burrito, but it looks like it won't deliver your Starbucks coffee (NASDAQ:SBUX). The Project Wing drone delivery program, now a part of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), has scrapped a Starbucks partnership as part of a cost-cutting move, sources told Bloomberg. The budget cuts also mean a hiring freeze and an attempt to shift employees to other projects. If you recently picked up one of GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) long-in-the-works Karma drones, you should probably return it. The company has issued a recall for all devices (around 2,500 since it was released on Oct. 23) because \"in a very small number of cases\" the Karmas lost power while in use.

ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) -7.3% premarket after the steel producer warned of weak profitability in Q4 with higher coal prices hitting margins. Facebook is testing a feature that would let page administrators create job postings and receive applications from candidates, a move that could pressure LinkedIn's (NYSE:LNKD) recruiting business. What's still unclear is if Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) plans to monetize the service. LinkedIn makes a hefty chunk of its revenue by tapping job hunters, recruiters and employers who pay monthly fees to connect on its platform. Samsung's exploding phone problem is far from over. A woman's Galaxy J5 reportedly caught fire and exploded in Pau, France this weekend, although she managed to toss it away before the back of the handset blew off.

A warning from General Electric has prompted cargo carrier FedEx (NYSE:FDX) to ground one of its planes temporarily. Engine parts of the jet were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk on American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Flight 383, which caught fire last month. GE subsequently discovered a \"material anomaly\" related to the disk. Iran plans to sign a preliminary $6B deal with Total (NYSE:TOT) today to help develop an offshore gas field, an agreement that would mark the first Western energy investment there since international sanctions were lifted this year. The \"heads of agreement\" for development of the giant South Pars gas field would also include China National Petroleum (NYSE:PTR) and Iran's state-owned Petropars. The U.S. Commerce Department has formally opened a China steel tariff-dodging probe. A petition filed in September by ArcelorMittal (MT), Nucor (NYSE:NUE), AK Steel (NYSE:AKS) and U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) alleged that Chinese steelmakers shipped metal to Vietnam, made enough changes to it that they could then classify it as Vietnamese, and then shipped it to the U.S. under lower tariffs. Adding a new risk to the deal's completion, U.S. state attorneys general have joined a federal antitrust probe of the planned merger between DuPont (NYSE:DD) and Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW), a transaction that could help reshape the global farm industry. About seven states have joined the probe, Reuters reports, adding that some of the AGs would also investigate the proposed merger of Monsanto (NYSE:MON) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY). Despite saying it would shutter the service, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) might still sell looping video app Vine, TechCrunch reports. Sources said some of the bids are below a $10M price point, rendering such a transaction relatively immaterial to Twitter's overall benefit should one emerge. The platform at one point was claimed to be costing that amount in infrastructure and employee expense on a monthly basis.

The companies, which originally merged in 2000 and split again at the beginning of 2006, had created special committees to look at the idea of getting back together as National Amusements - the holding company for Sumner Redstone that owns voting control of both - urged the two to examine a deal.

The request comes just a few weeks before the committee is slated to convene a hearing to scrutinize a pending $465M settlement that Mylan has said will resolve claims it underpaid rebates to state and federal Medicaid programs. Looking to draw a line under one of its longest-running customer service battles, RBS is putting aside £400M to reimburse clients who claim they were mistreated by its small business restructuring unit. The funds will go towards both an \"automatic refund of complex fees\" paid by such firms between 2008 and 2013, as well as operational costs of the complaints process. The SEC is probing whether big banks have been mishandling securities in the arcane but sizable market for American depositary receipts, WSJ reports.

Eurozone retail sales annual growth slowed for a second straight month in September, falling 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, according to preliminary data from Eurostat. The drop was mainly caused by a slump in sales of non-food products, with the sharpest declines seen in Germany, Portugal and Slovenia. Compared to the same month last year, retail sales were up 1.1%. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has reshuffled his cabinet in a bid to speed up bailout reforms so debt restructuring negotiations could start at an EU finance minister meeting on Dec. 5. The move could also help the country qualify for inclusion in the ECB's bond buying scheme and regain bond market access by 2018, when its current bailout program expires. Military buildup: Hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia, according to Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance's secretary-general.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in Seoul on Saturday to demand South Korean President Park Geun-hye step down over an explosive political scandal. While several politicians have individually called for the president's resignation, opposition parties have yet to attempt a serious push for her departure or impeachment in fear of negatively impacting next year's presidential election. Algeria Energy Minister Nouredine Bouterfa is confident OPEC members will stick to a pact made in September to cut output, saying the group's technical committee was working on applying the deal.

Crude futures +1.7% to $44.80/bbl. Wall Street bonuses are expected to decline for the third consecutive year, reflecting a period of busted mergers, limited trading activity, lack of new listings and muted hedge fund returns.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, missing for more than two years, may have plummeted at 25,000 feet a minute in its final moments and wasn't configured to land when it hit the water. Debris recovered from the missing Boeing 777 (NYSE:BA) indicates the right wing flap was positioned for cruising when it separated from the plane, casting new doubt over theories saying the crash was under human control. Uber is partnering with General Motors' (NYSE:GM) car-sharing service Maven to allow its drivers to rent vehicles on a weekly basis. The 90-day pilot is a surprise move for GM, which with LYFT- UBER's main competitor in North America - announced a $500M investment and program earlier this year called Express Drive used mostly by Lyft drivers. It seems like anything goes in the rapidly evolving personal mobility space. \"We expect SolarCity to add more than half a billion dollars in cash to Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) balance sheet over the next 3 years,\" the company said in advance of a Nov. 17 vote on the deal. \"We also expect SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY) to immediately account for 40% of the assets of the combined company on a historical cost basis, to contribute $1B+ in revenue in 2017.\" A major gasoline pipeline that is a crucial supply source for the U.S. East Coast could reopen as early as Saturday after an explosion in Alabama killed one worker and injured five others.

Cost cutting will continue to define the group's activities in the near term, as BP revised its 2016 capital expenditure guidance to $16B from $17B-$19B and warned about pressure on refining margins in Q4. BP -3% premarket. \"Shell delivered better results this quarter... but lower oil prices continue to be a significant challenge across the business, and the outlook remains uncertain,\" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement. Earnings on a current cost of supplies basis reached $1.4B in Q3, after contracting $6.1B a year ago, as higher production from acquisition BG Group and lower operating costs helped support earnings. RDS.A +3.3%; RDS.B +4.2% premarket. Ford has reached a tentative agreement with unionized workers in Canada, averting a strike that threatened to disrupt production at factories that account for nearly 10% of the automaker's North American output. Unifor said Ford (NYSE:F) would make investments in its Canadian operations in the area of C$700M and promised other undisclosed gains, but it may prove difficult to get the deal approved by members at meetings on Nov. 5 and 6. More Ford news: The company is postponing its October sales report, following a fire yesterday that caused it to evacuate headquarters. BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) has also signed a deal to work directly with the carmaker to expand its use of the QNX secure operating system. That opens an avenue into Ford's increasing push into automated vehicles and marks BlackBerry's first direct deal with a major automaker. A majority of Southwest Airlines' 14,500 flight attendants have approved a new labor agreement. The two-year contract includes a ratification bonus of almost 16% based on the average hours worked over the past three years and annual wage rate increases over the life of the contract. Southwest (NYSE:LUV), which is trying to find labor peace after a tumultuous period, was \"thrilled,\" said Sonya Lacore, vice president of cabin services. Valeant Pharmaceuticals +4% premarket after shares tanked just before the close on Monday in response to news that ex-CEO Michael Pearson and ex-CFO Howard Schiller are the focus of a DOJ fraud investigation. According to Bloomberg, the nature of the charges are related to the company's hidden ties to now-defunct Philidor, a specialty pharmacy that used dubious tactics to increase insurance reimbursements for Valeant (NYSE:VRX) products. Not a great quarter for Sony... Net income plunged 86% to ¥4.8B ($45.8M) from ¥33.6B in the same period last year, as the Japanese electronics giant got whacked by a stronger yen, costs from the sale of its battery business and softness in areas like games and semiconductors. Sony's (NYSE:SNE) cash-cow imaging sensor business also took a ¥1.2B hit due to damage from the Kumamoto earthquakes that closed down one of its factories. Apple Music may be preparing for a major price drop, a pair of sources \"working closely\" with the streaming service told Digital Music News. The changes are still under discussion, albeit \"under serious discussion.\" If implemented, the decrease could be as much as 20%, which would put the monthly regular rate below $8 and allow Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to minimize any damage from \"seriously undercutting Amazon Music (NASDAQ:AMZN).\" With Tom Dooley departing his interim position atop Viacom (VIA, VIAB), the company has named veteran Bob Bakish its acting president and CEO. The choice of an internal candidate and temporary-sounding title could be indications of just how quickly Viacom is expected to potentially reunite with its corporate sibling, CBS Corp. (NYSE:CBS), from which it was split off a decade ago. The board of directors of Reynolds American (NYSE:RAI) has formed a committee of independent directors, not designated by British American Tobacco (NYSEMKT:BTI), to evaluate the latter's $47B takeover offer.

The backlog of M\u0026A that had yet to be financed slid to $246B at the end of September from more than $900B in late 2015, according to BofA Merrill Lynch, but that figure has climbed 87% to $460B following the recent string of deal announcements. The new Bond King? After dozens of candidates, a designated committee and two different recruitment firms, Pimco (OTCQX:AZSEY) is finally welcoming its new CEO, Manny Roman. There are high hopes, as he becomes the third man to take to the helm since Bill Gross left in 2014.

According to Nielsen's most recent numbers, ESPN (NYSE:DIS) lost another 621K subscribers in October; the worst in its existence as a cable company. Generally, the network has been losing about 300K subscribers per month. ESPN is on track to spend $7.3B in rights fees in 2017, but given its shrinking subscriber base, it may be difficult for it to continue to license the most expensive content. Multiple sources say a long-rumored merger between DraftKings (Private:DRAFT) and FanDuel (Private:DUEL) is imminent; the pair's recent settlement with NY Attorney General Eric Schneiderman cleared a key obstacle to the pair-up.

Combined, the two firms cover 90-95% of the daily fantasy market. Credit Suisse is looking at partnering with other banks to cut costs. Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam told FT that cost saving projects with other lenders could mean a new level of savings.

New York's financial regulator had sights set on becoming a global hub for bitcoin (COIN, OTCQB:BTCS) when it adopted trailblazing virtual currency rules last year, but the state lost momentum when the agency's chief left, putting a licensing process in limbo. Since then, the Department of Financial Services has issued just two BitLicenses, according to a spokesman. Another 15 applications are still pending, with four others withdrawn and four denied. Putting the fizz back into its line-up, Coca-Cola Ginger (NYSE:KO) was launched Down Under today, as the South Hemisphere country ushers in summer.

The \"uncontained\" failure, which hurled fragments as far as half a mile from the scene, is unusual given modern protective casings, but at least four other planes powered by the same GE engine family have experienced serious malfunctions since 2000. With the industry suffering its worst-ever downturn, Japan's top three shippers - Nippon Yusen (OTCPK:NPNYY), Mitsui OSK Lines (OTCPK:MSLOY) and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (OTCPK:KAIKY) - said they will integrate their operations to create the world's sixth-largest player. Overcapacity and anemic economic growth globally have left hundreds of ships idle in the worst slump since the birth of containerization in the 1950s and 1960s, which culminated in the collapse in August of South Korea's Hanjin Shipping (OTC:HNJSF). A single market and customs union? Nissan's (OTCPK:NSANY) decision last week to keep investing in Britain came after Business Secretary Greg Clark told the carmaker the U.K. was aiming for tariff-free motor trade with Europe post-Brexit. At the same time, Theresa May has said she wants greater immigration controls and freedom from the oversight of the European court of justice; a combination of aims that Brussels politicians have repeatedly said is unachievable. Volkswagen plans to cut more than 10,000 jobs in coming years as the German auto giant switches its focus to making electric cars in the wake of its Dieselgate scandal. \"It's not about dismantling a few hundred jobs,\" VW's (OTCPK:VLKAY) head of human resources Karlheinz Blessing told Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \"Over the years, it will amount to a five-digit figure around the world.\" Forget about Mars and self-driving cars, Elon Musk has unveiled a new kind of solar roof that will be offered starting next year through SolarCity (NASDAQ:SCTY), the home solar installation company that he is seeking to merge into Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

Total (NYSE:TOT) topped expectations, thanks to cost cuts and an increase in output. AB Inbev (NYSE:BUD) -4% premarket due to woes in Brazil, cutting its guidance due to weakness in that market. The eve of a presidential election is typically a time when companies put merger plans on hold and wait for clarity on matters like antitrust policy. Not this year. U.S. companies have struck a total of $248.9B in merger agreements this month, surpassing the previous record of $240B in July 2015. More on the way? New reports suggest CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL) is eyeing a $30B merger with L3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) and GE is discussing an oil \u0026 gas combination with Baker Hughes (NYSE:BHI) for roughly the same amount. Mylan's price hikes on EpiPens have added millions to DoD spending since 2008 as the agency covered more prescriptions for the lifesaving allergy shot at near-retail prices, government data provided to Reuters shows.

Although Uber has barely tackled self-driving cars for the road, it's already dreaming about the skies. The company released a white paper envisioning a future - less than 10 years from now - in which commuters hop onto a small aircraft, take off vertically and within minutes arrive at their destinations.

Tesla also maintained its forecast for 50,000 cars delivered in this year's second half, after shipping 24,800 Model S and Model X's during the quarter. Volkswagen made €2.3B in net profit in the third quarter after a massive loss a year ago over its emissions cheating scandal. Brands such as Skoda, Bentley and Porsche (OTCPK:POAHY) managed to improve operating profit through increased sales and exchange rate effects. VW (OTCPK:VLKAY) also raised its full-year guidance for group revenue despite setting aside an additional €400M in Q3 relating to Dieselgate. After separating its car group's finances from its research lab X earlier this year, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) is now transforming its self-driving-car into a stand-alone business project under the Alphabet umbrella. It's a major step in the vehicles' path to commercial operations, writes the WSJ's Jack Nicas, and as its own operation, the car group would likely be expected to soon begin generating revenue (though not necessarily a profit). Surprise! Deutsche Bank reported a third-quarter profit on lower than estimated litigation and restructuring costs, but set aside an additional €501M as it \"works hard\" to settle a mortgage probe with the DOJ. Net income came in at €256M compared with a €6B loss in the year-earlier period. Deutsche (NYSE:DB) also agreed sell its Mexico units to InvestaBank, an exit that is part of CEO John Cryan's plan to revive the struggling German lender.

That could value the company at $25B-$35B, but the figure could climb as high as $40B.

A series of huge DOJ fines on Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) and Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) for mis-selling mortgage securities could be postponed until after next month's presidential election, Sky News reports. The delay also means RBS will likely have to account for the majority of a fine in its 2017 results, making it virtually certain that the bank will record its tenth consecutive annual loss. Synchrony Financial has joined R3, a group of companies working on blockchain technology, making it the first credit-card issuer to join the consortium. \"We have been watching very closely how blockchain systems are being built and how money may be moving,\" Synchrony (NYSE:SYF) Chief Information Officer Carol Juel told the WSJ. Blockchain could \"be a sea change\" in how financial transactions are processed. Reeling from the biggest and most costly car recall in history, Takata (OTCPK:TKTDY) is now at the center of a messy takeover battle that could put the company on a path towards bankruptcy.

In a major milestone for autonomous trucking, some 45,000 cans of Budweiser (NYSE:BUD) beer arrived late last week to a Colorado warehouse after traveling over 120 highway miles in a self-driving semi with no driver at the wheel.

Twitter is preparing to cut as many as 300 jobs, or about 8% of its workforce, sources told Bloomberg, the same percentage it did last year when co-founder Jack Dorsey took over as chief executive officer.

To Have Its Say On AT\u0026T/Time Warner Deal","body":"Next up for the blockbuster $85.4B deal for AT\u0026T (NYSE:T) to buy Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) is navigating the political landscape given what are certain to be objections by lawmakers and media/telecom rivals. Before the deal was even officially announced, Donald Trump was on the tape saying he would block it, while Clinton running mate Tim Kaine voiced his concerns a few hours later. Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) purchase of NBC Universal made it through in 2011, but not until after 13 months of review, and some have complained that conditions of the approval - such as its requirement to not weigh in on big decisions at Hulu - were tough to monitor and enforce. No stranger to making its way around D.C., AT\u0026T is no doubt stealing itself for what lay ahead, but CEO Randall Stephenson on a Saturday night conference call played down regulatory concerns, arguing this deal isn't increasing industry concentration, as it combines a content provider with a content distributor. Economy Markit's manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to a 30-month high of 53.3, topping estimates of 52.6. Germany's print of 55.1 was a 33-month high, and France's of 51.3 was the strongest in 10 months. Meanwhile in Spain, the re-election of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was assured after the Socialist party decided not to block him from forming a minority government. While the ending of gridlock is good news, it's still a minority government, and likely to be weak and unstable. Europe's Stoxx 600 is higher by 0.5%, led by Spain's 1.3% advance. Stocks In a cash and stock deal valued at $6.4B plus the assumption of $1.9B in debt, Rockwell Collins (NYSE:COL) has agreed to buy B/E Aerospace (NASDAQ:BEAV), combining two of the largest suppliers to airlines and plane makers. Each BEAV shareholder will receive $62/share, comprised of $34.10/share in cash and $27.90 in COL common shares (subject to a 7.5% collar), representing a 22.5% premium to Friday's closing price. The proposed deal continues the consolidation of the aerospace industry over the past two years as suppliers adjust to pressures from Boeing and Airbus to cut costs. Also today, both COL and BEAV issued earnings reports that slightly beat analyst expectations. As floated on Sunday, Scottrade has been sold to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) for $4B. The deal will take place in two stages, with TD Bank (NYSE:TD) first buying Scottrade Bank for $1.3B in cash, and then Ameritrade purchasing Scottrade Financial Services for $4B, or $2.7B of stock and cash net of the proceeds of the bank sale. Ameritrade will issue $1B in new stock (28M shares) to Scottrade, and the $1.7B in cash will include $900M of its own money, $400M in new debt and $400M raised by selling another 11M shares to TD Bank (TD Bank is already an owner of 42% of Ameritrade). Thanks to about $450M in combined annual expense synergies, Ameritrade expects 15-20% adjusted EPS accretion in years two and three following the close. Another $300M in longer-term cost savings are hoped for as well. A conference call is set for 8:30 AM ET. In a roughly $2.7B deal, Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW) has agreed to sell itself to China Oceanwide (OTC:HHRBF). That works out to $5.43 per share in cash, a puny 4.2% premium to Friday's close, but comes as Genworth announces more troubles with its long-term care business and an after-tax charge in Q3 of $275M-$325M. BTIG's Mark Palmer notes GNW would surely today have traded sharply lower than its most recent price of $5.21 were it not for the weekend sale. A conference call is set for 8:00 AM ET. The next wave of media consolidation will surely be on investors' minds today following AT\u0026T's weekend agreement to buy Time Warner. Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA), Scripps Networks (NYSE:SNI), AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX), Lions Gate (NYSE:LGF), Viacom (VIA, VIAB), and CBS already had their tails in the air on Friday afternoon as merger talk between AT\u0026T and Time Warner heated up.

Altice USA, which bought Cablevision and Suddenlink Communications over the last year or so, is worth $25-30B and could look to raise almost $2B. The move would provide Altice USA with currency - money and stock - to finance further expansion, such as by acquiring midsize players in deals that would be expected to receive antitrust clearance. Daimler's Q3 net profit climbed 8.8% to €2.595B, boosted by strong sales of the German car company's new Mercedes-Benz E-class models and sport-utility vehicles. Daimler's (OTCPK:DDAIF) revenues grew 4% to €38.6B, pretty much as expected, and volumes increased 5% to a record 754,100 units. Revenue at Mercedes-Benz Cars rose 12% to €23.3B, although truck sales slumped 19% to €7.8B as volume dropped to 97,100 from 128,500 a year earlier.

Canadian aerospace and train manufacturer Bombardier (OTCQX:BDRAF, OTCQX:BDRBF) plans to deepen its job-cuts program, saying it will axe 7,500 positions, or 10% of its global workforce, over the next two years as it doubles down on its efforts to turn around its rail division. Bombardier, which announced other job losses in February, expects recurring savings of about $300M by the end of 2018 from the latest move, although it will also take restructuring charges of $225-275M starting in Q4 2016. Ericsson's shares were -4.7% premarket after the telecom-network provider reported a Q3 net loss of 233M kronor ($26M), more than double estimates of 112M kronor. Last year the company made a profit of 3.1B kronor. Revenue last quarter dropped 14% to 51.1B kronor as Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC), which is without a CEO, continued to struggle with an industry slump and intense competition. \"Ericsson suffers from a bloated cost base, major dysfunctions and an empty CEO seat,\" said Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu, although he added that the company's market position remains strong.

Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments.\n\nIt’s been a week now, and the post-election narrative seems to be taking shape: Donald Trump’s shocking victory represents the revenge of the white working class over coastal elites. That narrative may be correct politically, but in terms of policy, it misses the mark in critical ways. Trump, if he sticks to his campaign pledges (a big “if”), will probably do little either to help the working class or to hurt the elites, at least economically. What’s more, this simple dichotomy completely leaves out the people who stand to lose the most, based on what little we know about Trump’s plans: poor and low-income families in urban and suburban areas.\n\nStart with the elites: Sure, affluent, college-educated residents of big cities voted against Trump by overwhelming margins. (Hillary Clinton won 86 percent of the vote in Manhattan, up from the 84 percent that voted for President Obama four years ago.) But the reaction of the financial markets to Trump’s win is a hint that it isn’t the elites who have the most to fear in a Trump presidency. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.4 percent last week, its best week since 2011; other major stock indexes were up nearly as much.\n\nShort-term market reactions don’t necessarily reveal much about the longer-term direction of the economy. But there’s a reason that investors are optimistic about a Trump presidency. Taken at face value, his policies contain plenty of good news for investors: tax cuts for the wealthy, lower corporate tax rates and much less regulation of banks, energy companies and other big businesses. And it isn’t just captains of industry who would benefit: Trump’s child-care plan, for example, would favor affluent families.\n\nOf course, college graduates and other members of the coastal elite weren’t necessarily voting against Trump because they thought he would be bad for them economically. Many were more concerned about his history of racist and sexist comments; his positions on immigration, abortion and criminal justice; or his overall temperament. But many of Trump’s white working-class supporters did cite economic issues as a significant concern. In his campaign, Trump pledged to bring back manufacturing jobs, get tough on foreign competitors and deport undocumented immigrants who, he said, push down the wages of American workers. Many of his voters have said they plan to hold him to those promises.\n\nThey are likely to be disappointed. Many of the economic grievances of the white working class are legitimate: Manufacturing jobs really have disappeared, and those that remain often don’t pay as well or offer the same benefits as the union jobs that workers remember from decades past. Economists, who said for years that trade’s downsides were minimal, have more recently begun to acknowledge that foreign competition has done lasting damage to many communities (though they still say trade is good for the economy as a whole). But despite his rhetoric, Trump offered few specifics during the campaign for how he would change trade policy to benefit workers; the plan his advisers did offer was widely panned by independent economists, some of whom warned it would cause a recession.\n\nThe larger problem for Trump and his supporters is that there is very little reason to think that any set of policies could meaningfully reverse the long-term decline in U.S. manufacturing jobs. That decline has been driven by a combination of globalization and automation — forces that aren’t likely to reverse any time soon. As I’ve argued in the past, politicians and policymakers would be better off focusing on how to improve the wages and working conditions of the service workers who now dominate the U.S. economy — a subject Trump barely mentioned during the campaign. Trump had little to say about education, job training, entrepreneurship or other policy areas that might help workers in rural areas. And though Trump has said that lighter regulation will help the struggling coal industry, that will do nothing to change the low natural-gas prices that are coal’s biggest enemy. Indeed, Trump has also pledged to ease regulation of fracking, which will tend to boost oil and gas production, which will in turn tend to keep prices low. (Clinton, it is worth noting, had a detailed plan to help coal country, although many experts were skeptical about its effectiveness.)\n\nFinally, there are the people who have gone practically unmentioned in the post-election coverage: low-income families outside of rural America and the Rust Belt. There were 43 million Americans living in poverty in 2015, and 36 million of them live in cities or, increasingly, suburbs. Poverty is higher in the South and West than in the Midwest, and it disproportionately affects African-Americans and Latinos, whose poverty rate is more than double that of non-Hispanic whites. Blacks and Latinos also face higher rates of unemployment, lower rates of high school and college graduation and higher rates of foreclosure than whites.\n\nIn debates and on the campaign trail, Trump talked — often inaccurately — about inner cities as pits of crime and despair. But he offered few policies for addressing the economic challenges facing minority communities. Trump, unsurprisingly, didn’t embrace traditional Democratic policies such as a higher minimum wage or stronger worker protections. (He has pledged to exempt small businesses from the Obama administration’s new rule making millions more Americans eligible for overtime pay.) But nor has he embraced proposals from Paul Ryan and other conservatives to address poverty through other policy initiatives such as the Earned Income Tax Credit. Trump’s plan to increase infrastructure spending and cut taxes could spur faster economic growth in the short term, which would help create jobs and boost wages (although over the weekend, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, one of the most vocal advocates for infrastructure spending, questioned whether Trump’s plan would be effective). But few of Trump’s policies would do much to help low-income communities in the longer run.\n\nEven the most policy-focused presidential candidates always leave key details unresolved during their campaigns; Trump was, perhaps, the least policy-focused major-party nominee in decades. That means he will take office as something of a blank slate. It is possible that once he takes office, he will begin rolling out detailed proposals to tackle the economic challenges facing both urban and rural America, and that he will be unafraid to take on the elites in the process. But there is little sign of that in the policies he has proposed so far.\n\nThe post-election parlor game of “guess the cabinet” doesn’t usually matter much to anyone outside of Washington. But this year, it takes on added importance. Trump provided few details about his policy positions during the campaign, and he isn’t surrounded by a well-known group of policy advisers. So his choice of cabinet members and other senior officials will provide a key glimpse into the direction he plans to take his presidency. Trump’s economic team is a particular question mark because hardly any mainstream economists backed his candidacy — hundreds of them, in fact, signed a letter explicitly opposing his election.\n\nBloomberg on Monday reported that Trump was close to naming Steven Mnuchin as his Treasury secretary. Mnuchin, who served as national finance chairman for Trump’s campaign, is a former Goldman Sachs partner, hedge-fund investor and Hollywood producer. (Steve Bannon, newly named to a top White House job, is also a Goldman alum.) Trump’s team is also rumored to have reached out to JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and to Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling. Trump is also likely to look to the private sector for other cabinet posts, such as the secretaries of commerce and energy.\n\nIt is less clear where Trump will turn to find people to fill other top economic posts, such as the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. One name that is likely to surface: Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, professor who coauthored a report explaining Trump’s economic policies.\n\nA Trump win was predicted to crash financial markets. It didn’t. On Wednesday, I looked at why not.\n\nTrump outperformed Mitt Romney in places that are struggling economically — and especially in places where jobs are most at risk in the future. On Thursday, Jed Kolko dug into the data. And on Friday, Andrew Flowers looked at the other demographic characteristics associated with “Trump Country”: a high proportion of residents who are white, older and less educated.\n\nThe foreclosure crisis hurt millions of homeowners. On Tuesday, Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux profiled a Supreme Court case in which cities are arguing that they, too, were harmed by banks’ alleged discriminatory lending practices.\n\nNew companies are hiring fewer workers. Anna Louie Sussman writes in The Wall Street Journal that that’s bad news for the economy.\n\nBinyamin Appelbaum asks what Trump will mean for Janet Yellen and the Federal Reserve.\n\nTrump’s business empire could create unprecedented conflicts of interest, especially because he has resisted calls to put his assets in a blind trust. Bloomberg View’s Timothy O’Brien (who has a long history with Trump) looks at Trump’s complex family, business and political ties.","description":"This is In Real Terms, a weekly column analyzing the latest economic news.

One problem: There almost certainly aren’t that many people who fit those criteria.\n\nIn a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he would prioritize deporting or incarcerating the immigrants who are both in the country illegally and who are “gang members, drug dealers” or have other criminal convictions. He said there are “a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million.”\n\nIt isn’t clear where Trump came up with those numbers. But according to the Department of Homeland Security, there are roughly 1.9 million non-citizen immigrants who have been convicted of crimes and are subject to deportation — what the government calls “removable criminal aliens.” That total, however, includes both undocumented immigrants and noncitizens in the country legally. The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, estimates that there are roughly 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally and that approximately 820,000 of them have criminal records. (The Migration Policy Institute doesn’t take positions on specific legislation but is generally seen as favoring immigration. The Pew Research Center, another think tank, comes up with a similar figure for the total number of undocumented immigrants.) Some of those immigrants are already incarcerated: A recent report from the Congressional Research Service estimated that at the end of 2013, there were more than 140,000 non-citizen immigrants in local, state and federal prisons and jails. (That figure includes people who are in the country legally, not all of whom are subject to deportation.)\n\nBeyond the specific numbers, the policy that Trump outlined Sunday is similar to the one President Obama pursued in his first term. When Obama first took office, he prioritized deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions, in some cases even for comparatively minor violations such as traffic offenses or shoplifting, according to Randy Capps of the Migration Policy Institute. Partly as a result, deportations soared under Obama, topping 400,000 in 2012.\n\nMore recently, however, the Obama administration has changed tack, focusing instead on deporting immigrants convicted of more serious crimes or for repeat offenses. (He has also consistently deported undocumented immigrants who entered the country recently.) Deportations have fallen steadily in Obama’s second term, to below 250,000 in 2015.\n\nCapps said that the Homeland Security Department still has the resources it had in Obama’s first term. From a practical standpoint, then, it wouldn’t be hard for the government to deport 400,000 or even 500,000 people per year — meaning that Trump could credibly deport 2 million people during his first term without requiring additional resources or authorization from Congress. Many, but not all, of the people deported would be convicted criminals.\n\n“It would not be hard to get up to 2 million in four years, and most of them would be quote-unquote criminals,” Capps said, although he added that many of those criminal convictions would be for relatively minor crimes.\n\nTrump is also likely to roll back a central element of Obama’s immigration agenda: his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers temporary legal status to people who entered the country illegally as children. During the campaign, Trump pledged to end DACA, but he hasn’t said how — whether he will close the program to new applicants, allow it to expire or end it even for the roughly three-quarters of a million people who have been granted legal status under the program.\n\n“The proof is going to be in what his administration actually does,” Capps said, “and it will take some time before we know that.”","description":"Donald Trump wants to immediately deport 2 million to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

Romney, like other recent Republican nominees, drew strong support in rural areas, which tend to be whiter and have fewer residents with college degrees. But Trump extended the GOP’s advantages in those areas, in many cases substantially.\n\nThis analysis is based on county-level voting data from Dave Leip’s Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections. The data is preliminary: We have data for 2,902 of 3,142 U.S. counties, but vote tallies in some of those 2,902 counties are incomplete. The numbers for California and Washington, notably, are missing many votes. Demographic data comes from the 2010-14 American Community Survey.\n\nDemographic patterns alone won’t resolve the “why did Trump win?” question, especially because, as Jed Kolko wrote Thursday, economic, demographic and cultural factors are frequently interconnected. But they do show how Trump accelerated recent partisan shifts and remade the electoral map — in the process further reshaping the Republican Party.\n\nTake age, for instance. Trump and Romney both did well in counties with a larger share of older people, but Trump did better. Trump outperformed Romney by 3 percentage points in counties with less than 20 percent of the population age 60 and over but by nearly 12 points in counties where this group constituted over 30 percent of the population. (All trend lines in the charts below are weighted by county-level voter turnout in 2016.)\n\nRace tells a similar story. Perhaps surprisingly, given his comments about Mexican immigrants and other minority groups, Trump did better than Romney in “majority minority” counties, those where non-Hispanic whites make up less than 50 percent of the population. His margins there were 4.5 percentage points better than Romney’s (though he lost them to Hillary Clinton by a wide margin). But in counties where the white population share was above 75 percent, Trump did 13 percentage points better than Romney, and in counties where whites are more than 90 percent of the population, Trump outperformed Romney by an astounding 17 points.\n\nWhile Trump did well in whiter areas, he also overperformed in places that have seen an influx of nonwhites in recent years. A Wall Street Journal analysis before the election found that Trump was especially popular in counties that had become significantly more diverse over the past 15 years. These areas are often still mostly white, but are changing quickly.\n\nTrump Country has fewer immigrants, too: The higher the foreign-born population share of a county, the worse Trump performed. In the 91 counties where immigrants form more than 20 percent of the population, Trump did about 2 percentage points worse than Romney did in 2012, even though he outperformed Romney by about 2.5 points overall. But in the 503 counties where immigrants are less than 1 percent of the population, Trump beat Romney’s margins by 17 points.\n\nBut perhaps no demographic variable reflects Trump’s electoral success better than education does. In counties where less than 20 percent of the population has a bachelor’s degree or higher, Trump exceeded Romney’s margins by 14 percentage points. And, conversely, counties with more than 40 percent of the population having completed higher education, Trump did 6 percentage points worse than Romney.\n\nCORRECTION (Nov. 11, 2:13 p.m.): An earlier version of a chart accompanying this article misstated the type of counties in which Trump outperformed Romney. He did better in less-educated counties, not more-educated counties.\n\nReuben Fischer-Baum and Dhrumil Mehta contributed research.","description":"Donald Trump won Tuesday’s election by racking up big margins in counties that are, on average, older, whiter and less-educated than the rest of the U.S. The de…","keywords":"","time":1478889805,"url":"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/where-trump-got-his-edge/"},{"title":"Trump Was Stronger Where The Economy Is Weaker","body":"Donald Trump performed best on Tuesday in places where the economy is in worse shape, and especially in places where jobs are most at risk in the future.\n\nTrump, who in his campaign pledged to be a voice for “forgotten Americans,” beat Hillary Clinton in counties with slower job growth and lower wages. And he far outperformed her in counties where more jobs are threatened by automation or offshoring, a sign that he found support not just among workers who are struggling now but among those concerned for their economic future.\n\nIn the months leading up to Tuesday’s vote, experts debated how much Trump’s support was driven by economic anxiety or by racism, xenophobia or other factors. These reasons are not mutually exclusive, of course, and the debate will continue long into Trump’s presidency. But county-level voting results suggest that economic issues underpinned at least some of Trump’s support.\n\nThe relationship between economic issues and Trump’s support is not straightforward. Earlier analyses, based on pre-election polls, suggested that Trump’s backers were wealthier on average than Clinton’s. Actual election results show no correlation between counties’ September 2016 unemployment rates and their level of support for Trump — places with higher unemployment rates were no more likely to vote for Trump than those with lower rates. (County-level voting data is provided by Dave Leip’s U.S. Election Atlas. These figures are from version 0.2, which are preliminary, contain omissions and possibly errors and will be revised.)\n\nUnemployment, however, is a crude measure of a local economy. The government’s official definition of unemployment ignores people who have stopped looking for work or who have moved away altogether, and it doesn’t distinguish between a full-time job at a factory and a part-time job at a fast-food restaurant. Measures that do account for these factors generally suggest a stronger relationship between the economy and Trump’s support. Counties with weaker job growth since 2012, for example, were more likely to support Trump; the same is true for places with lower average earnings among full-time workers.\n\nEconomic anxiety is about the future, not just the present. Trump beat Clinton in counties where more jobs are at risk because of technology or globalization. Specifically, counties with the most “routine” jobs — those in manufacturing, sales, clerical work and related occupations that are easier to automate or send offshore — were far more likely to vote for Trump.\n\nComparing Trump’s vote share and other variables can only take us so far, however. For the most part, Trump did better in places that typically vote Republican — there is a strong correlation between how Trump performed in 2016 and how Mitt Romney performed four years earlier. So if routine jobs tend to be concentrated in Republican-leaning areas — as I found a few months ago — that doesn’t necessarily reveal much about whether economic anxiety fueled Trump’s support, in particular.\n\nRelated: Elections Podcast\n\nElections Podcast: President Trump\n\nInstead, to understand what drove Trump’s victory, we can look at how Trump’s margin against Clinton in 2016 compared with Romney’s against President Obama in 2012. Sure enough, the swing toward Trump was much stronger in counties with a higher share of routine jobs; the swing toward Trump was also stronger where unemployment was higher, job growth was slower and earnings were lower.\n\nDemographic factors such as age, race and immigrant share also correlate with the swing toward Trump, although among these only age correlates as strongly as routine job share. However, it’s nearly impossible to disentangle economic factors from other explanations for Trump’s victory because demographic characteristics and economic conditions are themselves related: Counties with older populations tend to have higher unemployment, slower job growth and a higher routine-job share. And some measures are clearly intertwined with both economic and social issues. For instance, counties where more adults are college educated have dramatically higher earnings and a lower routine-job share, but also lots of other favorable social, health and economic outcomes.\n\nStill, it is clear that the places that voted for Trump are under greater economic stress, and the places that swung most toward Trump are those where jobs are most under threat. Importantly, Trump’s appeal was strongest in places where people are most concerned about what the future will mean for their jobs, even if those aren’t the places where economic conditions are worst today.","description":"Donald Trump performed best on Tuesday in places where the economy is in worse shape, and especially in places where jobs are most at risk in the future.

That’s what economists had been predicting for weeks, based on investors’ reactions to news events during the campaign. And it’s what seemed to be happening during the evening, as futures markets (which are open even when stock markets themselves are closed) tumbled further with each new hint of a Trump victory. At one point in the night, futures markets suggested the Dow Jones Industrial Average would start the day down 1,000 points, worse than the worst days of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nYet when the bell rang on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, the initial reaction was comparative calm. The major stock indexes opened slightly higher, and then, unexpectedly, began to rise. By noon, the Dow was up more than 200 points. It ended the day up 257 points. The S\u0026P 500 closed up 1.1 percent.\n\nDivining why markets move the way they do is always a risky proposition. But most analysts today seemed to see the surprise rally as as sign of relief rather than excitement. Investors didn’t necessarily want Trump to win (although many probably liked some of his proposals, such as lower corporate taxes and reduced regulation), but even more than that they feared the chaos that could result from an uncertain or disputed outcome. Markets began to calm down when Clinton conceded and Trump gave a relatively conciliatory acceptance speech — in other words, once it became clear that even a shocking election result would nonetheless be followed by an orderly transfer of power.\n\nA few weeks back, I warned that it was risky — even irresponsible — to confidently predict how markets would react to a Trump victory. But it is just as unwise to read too much into one day of trading. Investors were relieved that Trump’s win didn’t lead to widespread protests or worse; their mood could easily shift once Trump starts naming his Cabinet members or announcing specific policy proposals.\n\nEven more uncertain is the effect that Trump’s victory will have on the economy as a whole. During the campaign, Trump promised to curb immigration and tear up trade deals — policies that various economic analyses have found could cause a recession. Trump has also promised to cut taxes by trillions of dollars, mostly for the rich, while preserving spending on Social Security, Medicare and the military — a position that, taken literally, would require huge cuts to other government programs.\n\nBut it’s too early to say how much of Trump’s agenda will be enacted. His positions on immigration, taxes and trade differ in important ways from those of House Speaker Paul Ryan, and although Democrats failed to retake control of the Senate, they held onto enough states to sustain a filibuster. Trump has also provided few details on many of his policy proposals, and on some issues, such as taxes and the minimum wage, has offered multiple, conflicting versions of his plans.\n\nNot all of Trump’s proposals would necessarily be bad for the economy. He wants to boost infrastructure spending, a position that’s broadly supported by economists (although Trump hasn’t given many details). He wants to implement a new tax deduction for child care expenses and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. Some elements of his tax plan, such as eliminating the estate tax and lowering the corporate income tax rate, hew to standard conservative orthodoxy, although he departs from it in other ways.\n\nMany people over the past day have compared Trump’s win with the U.K.s surprise decision in June to leave the European Union. There are clear parallels. Markets tanked in the immediate aftermath of the “Brexit” vote but have since rebounded, and the vote itself doesn’t seem to have devastated the British economy (although the value of the pound has taken a beating). But just as Trump is not yet president, the U.K. has not yet left the EU. Only when it does will the full consequences of Brexit become clear.\n\nThe lesson from Wednesday, then, is not to take away any lessons too quickly. Trump’s mere election hasn’t caused a crisis in either markets or the economy. That doesn’t mean that his presidency won’t.","description":"If there’s one thing that seemed certain on a very uncertain election night, it was that investors would hit the panic button as soon as the world woke up to th…","keywords":"","time":1478731495,"url":"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-win-hasnt-crashed-the-markets-at-least-not-yet/"},{"title":"Can Miami Convince The Supreme Court That Subprime Loans Hurt Cities, Too?","body":"In the aftermath of the housing crisis of 2008, big banks such as Wells Fargo shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to black and Latino borrowers who claimed they were steered into higher-risk, higher-fee loans than were white borrowers who presented the same credit risk. But these individual homeowners weren’t the only ones affected by the foreclosures that left entire neighborhoods full of empty, boarded-up houses. City governments were also suddenly faced with maintaining these crumbling swaths of real estate. While property values and tax revenues fell, they dispatched police and firefighters to protect the homes from vandalism and criminal activity. Should they also be able to go after the banks for financial damages?\n\nThat’s the question facing the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Cities such as Miami, Los Angeles, Providence, Birmingham, Memphis and Baltimore have all sued the banks, using the Fair Housing Act to argue that they were financially injured by the racially discriminatory lending practices. A few of these lawsuits have already settled, but the Supreme Court will hear arguments in Miami’s case, which two banks — Wells Fargo and Bank of America — have asked the courts to dismiss, claiming that cities are abusing a law designed to protect against segregation, not guarantee municipal tax revenues.\n\nWhile one important issue in the case is a purely legal question — whether cities have standing to sue — the heart of the case is an empirical challenge: Can the cities prove that they were directly and measurably harmed by the banks’ discriminatory lending practices? The Fair Housing Act is cities’ best chance to reclaim some of the money lost during the financial crisis, according to lawyers I spoke to, even though it means the cities can only claim damages caused by discrimination. The banks say it’s impossible for Miami or any other city to prove that their actions led directly to the cities’ financial troubles. But Miami nevertheless claims that there is ample evidence to suggest that when banks discriminate against borrowers, cities are victimized, too.\n\nBecause the lawsuit is still in an early stage, Miami has yet to produce a figure for damages — a number that would indicate the extent to which the city’s attorneys and analysts believe it was materially harmed. And because the lawsuit is being filed under the Fair Housing Act, cities don’t just need to prove that they were harmed by predatory lending, which affected borrowers of all races; they have to link their financial losses specifically to discriminatory lending practices. But housing scholars such as Jacob Rugh, a sociologist at Brigham Young University, say that although it’s difficult at this stage to assess the strength of Miami’s particular case, there is a strong empirical argument for allowing cities to sue.\n\nThe story begins, Rugh said, in the late 1990s, when banks began marketing high-risk, high-fee home loans to black and Latino borrowers, especially those living in segregated neighborhoods. In a study published in 2015, Rugh and his co-authors examined 3,027 home loans in Baltimore (one of the few cities that has successfully settled a Fair Housing Act lawsuit against a bank) made between 2000 and 2008.\n\nWhen they controlled for basic loan characteristics such as credit score, down payment, and income, they found that black borrowers were channeled into higher-risk, higher-fee loans than were white borrowers with similar credit histories. These findings were compounded for black borrowers living in predominantly black neighborhoods: The study found that relative to comparable white borrowers, the average black borrower in Baltimore paid an estimated $1,739 in excess mortgage payments from the time the loan was made, a figure that was even higher for black borrowers in black neighborhoods.\n\n“When you look at the data, some of what you’re seeing are just bad loans, distributed across racial groups; many white borrowers got these high-risk loans, too,” Rugh said. “But it’s clear at this point that black and Latino borrowers were likelier than similarly situated white borrowers to be channeled into high-risk products.” As a result, minority borrowers were also substantially likelier than white borrowers to enter foreclosure. That these borrowers also tended to be concentrated in segregated areas meant that cities were suddenly faced with entire neighborhoods full of abandoned homes. And although not all of these foreclosures were the result of discrimination, Rugh said, there’s evidence that a substantial subset of houses were lost because the banks disproportionately targeted these minority borrowers.\n\nSome economists question whether findings such as Rugh’s should be chalked up to overt discrimination on the part of the banks, or whether the racial disparities in high-risk lending were the result of other factors. Anthony Yezer, a professor of economics at George Washington University, said that the disparities can be explained — at least in part — by the fact that people from minority backgrounds are less likely to shop around while looking for a mortgage. “Any group that is relatively less educated, relatively less numerate, won’t get the same price as the group that is financially literate,” he said.\n\nIn an amicus brief filed in support of Miami, a group of housing scholars argued that there is a direct link between the harm to borrowers documented by people such as Rugh and financial losses incurred by cities. Citing more than a decade of economic and sociological research from a variety of sources, Justin Steil, a professor of law and urban planning at MIT and one of the authors of the brief, explained, “the data is well established that foreclosures do lead to decreases in neighboring property values, which then lead to decreases in city revenues. Foreclosures,” he added, “also lead to more expenditures by the city in re-securing those properties, dealing with the vandalism, squatting, fires. And if the neighborhoods don’t recover, it just remains an ongoing problem for those communities to deal with.”\n\nSupporters of the banks in this case say that if anything, leaders of cities like Miami encouraged the influx of credit into their municipalities. “I really think Miami wants to have this both ways,” said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute. “If the banks weren’t doing business in Miami, they’d have a problem with that. It’s hard for me to believe that Miami would have been better off if Bank of America and Wells Fargo hadn’t been there.”\n\nThere has been an effort to determine more generally what would have happened if the banks hadn’t offered such a glut of high-risk loans, especially to minority borrowers living in segregated neighborhoods, according to Dan Immergluck, an urban planning professor at Georgia Tech. Immergluck hasn’t looked at Miami specifically, but he has been studying the disparate impact of high-risk loans for more than 20 years. “You compare neighborhoods that were targeted for these loans with neighborhoods that weren’t targeted, and the results are clear: The neighborhoods that weren’t targeted did much better,” he said. He added that, if anything, the data about the relationship between foreclosures and surrounding property values are remarkably consistent. “It makes sense, in an intuitive way,” he said. “This cycle that inflates values unsustainably and then lets them crash — the housing prices end up lower than they were before the cycle started, and it’s very difficult for neighborhoods to recover.”\n\nEstablishing that cities suffered as a result of the banks’ lending practices is just the beginning, though. If the Supreme Court allows Miami’s lawsuit to go forward, the city will next have to figure out how much money to demand from the banks and be able to defend that number in court. Coming up with a compelling estimate of damages will be challenging but not impossible, according to Immergluck. “The most obvious avenue is to assess lost property value and its effect on marginal tax revenue over time,” he said. But there are other factors that can be traced back to individual foreclosure-related home vacancies: the cost of handling vacant properties, including fire prevention, police protection and code enforcement costs.\n\nPursuing this kind of analysis would be painstaking and expensive for the cities, said Kathleen Engel, a research professor at Suffolk University Law School. “It’s clear at this point that the cities have to point to specific pieces of property and say, ‘Wells Fargo, you made a loan on this property that was unaffordable and part of this pattern of racial discrimination, you foreclosed on it, it became dilapidated and we spent X dollars cleaning it up or tearing it down,’” she said.\n\nIn Baltimore’s case against Wells Fargo, which was settled in 2012 as part of a larger case brought by the Department of Justice, the city identified its out-of-pocket costs in maintaining nearly 200 properties that the city claimed were empty as a result of Wells Fargo’s discriminatory lending practices. The challenge was twofold: identifying properties that became vacant because of the banks’ lending practices, and then pulling together all the data related to the properties. “It’s really a lot of work, for an uncertain payoff,” Engel said. Baltimore received $7.5 million in damages from Wells Fargo.\n\nRegardless of the outcome in each individual case, Engel thinks it’s important for cities to have a form of legal recourse. “The cities always get left out in the cold, because they don’t really have the power to prevent a crisis like this but they always have to bear the cost,” she said. Steil, the MIT professor, added that the cities have a legal obligation to act as advocates for their residents, especially in cases where an individual borrower might not be aware of the broader forces at work. “You need some sort of collective entity taking a look at what’s happening and evaluating patterns,” he said. “An essential part of this case is establishing that cities have a real stake in what’s happening to their residents, and they need to be able to act on their behalf.”\n\nSo far, civil rights advocates have argued that settlements such as Baltimore’s are just a drop in the bucket. Without more aggressive action, they claim, banks will just continue engaging in new but equally problematic behaviors. In the housing scholars’ amicus brief, Steil and his co-authors pointed to the new dearth of credit for black and Latino homeowners as another form of discriminatory lending that perpetuates segregation and stymies the recovery of black and Latino neighborhoods. But if the Supreme Court prevents them from suing under the Fair Housing Act, cities may have lost their best chance to hold the banks accountable for predatory lending.","description":"In the aftermath of the housing crisis of 2008, big banks such as Wells Fargo shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to black and Latino borrowers who clai…","keywords":"","time":1478606409,"url":"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-miami-convince-the-supreme-court-that-subprime-loans-hurt-cities-too/"},{"title":"The Economic Challenges Facing The Next President","body":"This is In Real Terms, a weekly column analyzing the latest economic news. Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments.\n\nWhen President Obama won the presidency in 2008, there was no doubt what his economic priority needed to be: Stop the bleeding. Three days after Obama was elected, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. had lost 240,000 jobs the month before, a figure that was later revised to a loss of 473,000 jobs. More than 1.5 million more would follow before Obama even took office.\n\nThere is no similar crisis greeting the winner of Tuesday’s election. The economy has added jobs for an unprecedented 73 consecutive months, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent. The jobs report, which brought such bad news eight years ago, on Friday showed solid hiring and, at long last, rising wages.\n\nBut while the crisis may have passed, the next president will inherit a long list of economic challenges, many of which predate the 2008-09 recession. Economic growth is slow; inequality is high; education and health care are expensive; entrepreneurship is falling. The problems Obama faced when he took office were immediate, an economic heart attack in need of emergency intervention. Today’s problems are chronic — slower moving but perhaps no less severe, and possibly the cause of further heart attacks in the future.\n\nPresidents have little control over the short-term direction of the economy. But they can have an impact on the kind of longer-run challenges now facing the U.S. So to figure out where the next president should focus her or his attention, I spent the week on the phone with economists across the political spectrum. Unsurprisingly, they didn’t agree on much when it came to the policies the new president should adopt. But there was much more agreement on the problems that need solving. Here are five of the biggest:\n\nJobs and wages: With unemployment low and pay rising, it is tempting to declare the job market fully healed from the recession. And indeed there are some economists who believe the U.S. is at or close to “full employment,” meaning that pretty much everyone who wants a job either has one or can find one quickly. But the balance of the evidence suggests that there is still room for the job market to improve. In October, 78.2 percent of Americans in their prime working years, those ages 25 to 54, had jobs, down from 79.7 percent when the recession began in December 2007. That’s a gap of close to 2 million people. Another nearly 6 million are working part-time because they can’t find full-time work.\n\n“In my mind we still have a very incomplete recovery,” said Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank.\n\nPerhaps even more concerning are the various groups that seem to have been left behind not just by the recovery but by the modern economy as a whole. The unemployment rate for Americans without a high school diploma was 7.3 percent in October. For young black men ages 25 to 34, it was 8.9 percent. In some rural areas, unemployment rates are still in the double digits. For those people, even a strong national recovery is unlikely to bring relief; helping them will require policies that specifically target places and groups that have in many cases been struggling for decades.\n\nSlow productivity growth: Productivity — in its simplest form, the economic output the average worker can produce in an hour — is a more esoteric concept than jobs or wages, but it is central to a well-functioning economy. Productivity growth is the reason that incomes and standards of living are able to keep rising without everyone just working more hours. But in recent years, productivity has been rising more slowly than in previous decades; on Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that U.S. productivity in the third quarter was unchanged from a year earlier.\n\nMany economists see slow productivity growth as the root of many of the nation’s other economic challenges. It’s part of the reason wages are rising slowly — if workers aren’t producing more, companies can’t afford to pay them more. It’s part of the reason that many economists worry about the national debt — if the economy is growing more slowly, the debt will be harder to pay off. “In the long run, it’s certainly as important and probably more important than job creation,” said Martin Baily, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Bill Clinton and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe trouble, Baily said, is that no one is sure why productivity has slowed, which makes it hard to revive it again. Some economists, such as Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon, think recent technological innovations, such as the internet, just aren’t as significant economically as earlier gains such as the invention of the steam engine. Others, such as Harvard professor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, see low productivity growth as stemming from a broader, global economic slowdown. Still others question the notion of sluggish productivity and suggest we are measuring it wrong.\n\nIn the absence of a clear culprit, some economists suggest a kitchen-sink approach: Try a wide range of policies that theoretically could increase productivity — investment in infrastructure, early childhood education, scientific research — and hope that some of it works.\n\n“Everything we do in terms of economic policy essentially needs to be thought of as buying lottery tickets for productivity,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The payout is so large.”\n\nDeclining dynamism: The U.S. economy is in constant motion: People find jobs and leave them; companies are founded and go out of business; families pick up stakes and move for better opportunities elsewhere. Yet in recent decades, that motion has been slowing. Americans are changing jobs less often, starting fewer companies and moving less frequently.\n\nThose trends worry economists because all that motion was a big part of what made the U.S. such a powerful economic force in the decades after World War II. Entrepreneurship helps drive innovation, and then spreads that innovation through the economy as other companies are forced to adapt or die. Job turnover helps match workers with the jobs where they are most productive. Geographic mobility helps make sure that workers go where the jobs are. An economy with less motion may be more comfortable for individuals and companies that are already well-established, but it provides fewer opportunities for those trying to break in, and it is less dynamic overall.\n\nAs with slowing productivity, economists aren’t sure what’s behind the decline in measures of economic dynamism. Conservatives argue unnecessary regulations discourage entrepreneurship and hiring. Liberals argue that corporations use their political and economic power to stamp out competition. (Though even their proponents see those as little more than partial explanations.) But there are points of agreement: Both Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about the spread of occupational licensing laws, which can make it harder for workers to change careers. Reforming the patent system, originally intended to help promote innovation but which many experts now fear stifles it, is another effort that has drawn bipartisan support.\n\n“It’s a lot harder to enter a new occupation than it should be, it’s a lot harder to start a business than it should be,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\nLow economic mobility: The presidential campaign has often focused on inequality (particularly on the Democratic side) and the stagnation of household income (particularly on the Republican side). Both those issues are important. But perhaps equally important is the less-discussed issue of economic mobility: how likely it is that a child born into poverty can rise into the middle class or above. Recent research from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and others has found that rates of mobility in the U.S. are low overall, and that they vary substantially from one part of the country to another — a poor child in Baltimore is much less likely to rise into the middle class than one in Boston. Though the U.S. has a self-image as a classless society, its mobility rates are lower than those in many European countries.\n\nMobility is harder to measure than many other economic trends; Chetty’s work was only possible because he was able to tap into a massive dataset of tax records from the IRS that allowed him to track individuals’ earnings over decades. And it could be politically hard to tackle as well. Richard V. Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, notes that mobility is by definition zero-sum — if it is easier for the poor to become rich, then it must also be easier for the rich to fall down the earnings ladder. Perhaps as a result, we don’t know much about what drives mobility. “This is an area where we really are needing more genuine experimentation and evaluation,” Reeves said. “We’re still feeling our way.”\n\nMistrust of government: The presidential campaign has laid bare Americans’ deep distrust of institutions — government, the media, the FBI, the Federal Reserve. Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank at George Mason University, argues that mistrust of government poses an economic challenge, not just a social one. Addressing the nation’s economic issues will require big changes, many of which will probably be unpopular. Reforming Social Security, fixing health care, overhauling the tax code — all of these will require sacrifices by some groups in order to improve things for the majority. That’s hard to do in an environment where people trust neither their leaders nor each other.\n\nOn Thursday, following up on last week’s column about immigration, I pointed to new research showing that undocumented immigrants are no longer growing as a share of the U.S. workforce.\n\nAlso on Thursday, Clare Malone took a close look at an Ohio county that has fallen on hard economic times — and that might help tip the state to Trump as a result.\n\nJob growth is slowing, but Friday’s employment report showed that Americans are finally starting to see fatter paychecks.\n\nTrump and Clinton both want to fix America’s infrastructure. Economists agree that’s a good idea. But dig a bit deeper, as Andrew Flowers did on Saturday, and that consensus falls apart.\n\nTrump often claims that economic data, especially the unemployment rate, is “rigged” to make President Obama look good. Patricia Cohen of The New York Times looks at how the government prevents political interference in U.S. economic data.\n\nThe unspoken assumption behind pretty much all economic commentary is that growth is good and more growth is better. Alana Semuels of The Atlantic asks whether that assumption makes sense.\n\nTrump isn’t doing better in states or counties with lots of diversity. He’s doing better in places where diversity is rising the most rapidly, according to an analysis by Janet Adamy and Paul Overberg in The Wall Street Journal.","description":"This is In Real Terms, a weekly column analyzing the latest economic news.

But That Doesn’t Mean They’ll Succeed.","body":"If there’s one issue that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on, it’s that America’s infrastructure is in need of an upgrade. Many of the nation’s highways and bridges are deficient; its airports and waterways are clogged; its power lines and levees are in disrepair.\n\nBoth presidential candidates say it’s time for a fix. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have each promised to boost infrastructure spending by hundreds of billions of dollars, which would dwarf the investments made under President Obama’s 2009 stimulus bill. And it isn’t just politicians: Many economists also think infrastructure should be a priority.\n\nBut peek beneath the surface and that apparent consensus disappears. Democrats, for example, want to borrow money to pay for new investments in infrastructure, while Republicans would rather cut spending elsewhere or rely on the private sector. The real difference, though, is less between left and right than between politicians and economists. Politicians have an incentive to favor projects that provide a quick infusion of jobs that they can point to in their next re-election campaign; economists are more concerned about the long term. Politicians tend to favor impressive new projects they can put their names on; many economists would rather focus on repairing and upgrading existing infrastructure. And there are also disagreements over how much to spend on infrastructure projects and how to pay for them.\n\nStill, infrastructure is a rare policy area in which action seems possible under the next president and Congress. Here are four questions that will help determine whether an infrastructure deal is good economics as well as good politics.\n\nThere are several arguments for why we should improve America’s infrastructure, and they sometimes get conflated in the public debate. Some policymakers, particularly on the left, see infrastructure investment primarily as a jobs program, like the New Deal’s Works Progress Administration. In this framing, the goal of infrastructure spending is to provide a short-term stimulus that jump-starts the economy — more jobs lead to more spending, which leads to more hiring, and so on.\n\nMany economists embraced that logic during the depths of the recession in 2008-09 and in the early stages of the recovery, when the economy badly needed a boost. But now, with the unemployment rate at 4.9 percent, the need for an immediate stimulus is less clear. Some economists, especially conservative ones, are skeptical that government spending does much to boost the economy outside of recessions.\n\n“The public discussion cherry-picks examples — ‘look at the internet, look at the Hoover Dam,’” said Andrew Warner, an economist at the International Monetary Fund who has studied large infrastructure booms in other nations. “It’s just not obvious that past infrastructure surges have had these big effects as advertised.”\n\nInstead, many economists see infrastructure spending as a long-term investment that enhances productivity. By eliminating bottlenecks in energy, transportation and communications, they say, an infrastructure-spending boost would make the whole economy more efficient, which in turn would let it grow more quickly. (In economics jargon, it would raise the economy’s potential growth rate, which has been lagging.) In this framing, the economic returns to upgrading our infrastructure won’t materialize quickly, but will be realized over decades. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that it often takes 20 years for the full effects of federal infrastructure investment to be felt.\n\n“I think of it as a long-term economic growth issue,” said Keith Hennessey, a lecturer at Stanford and the former head of President George W. Bush’s National Economic Council. “If it increases short-term employment, great — but that’s not as important.”\n\nShort-term employment is, however, important to politicians, who want results that will help them win re-election. That difference in emphasis can have practical implications: It gives politicians an incentive to push for projects that create the most jobs quickly, rather than ones that offer the best payoff in the long term.\n\nNot all economists see a tension between short-term and long-term goals. Larry Summers, a Harvard economist who has become a prominent advocate of increased infrastructure spending, said that part of what makes such investments attractive is that they offer both immediate and longer-lasting benefits.\n\nAnother decision that policymakers face is whether to focus on building new projects or maintaining old ones. The nation’s roads, bridges and airports have a massive backlog of deferred maintenance. Many economists see that backlog as a top infrastructure priority: A 2011 report from the Brookings Institution recommended redirecting all revenue from the federal gasoline tax to “repair, maintain, rehabilitate, reconstruct, and enhance existing roads and bridges.”\n\nEconomists like spending on repairs and maintenance because it’s cheaper in the long run to maintain existing infrastructure than to let it deteriorate and be forced to start over. Maintenance also takes out the guesswork — we already know which bridges and highways are the most valuable. “One of the benefits of an emphasis on deferred maintenance is that it’s done on the infrastructure that’s heavily used,” said Summers, who served in the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n\nBut politicians might not play along. A new bridge or expressway is more marketable than filling potholes — hence the “bridges to nowhere” that occasionally make headlines. Some research has suggested that political incentives lead governments to direct resources to overly expensive or unnecessary projects and to underinvest in maintenance.\n\nIn the end, the new president and Congress may not have much control over which projects are chosen. A large share of federal infrastructure spending is executed by block grants to state and local governments, which decide how the money gets spent.\n\nSome economists consider that a good thing. “Let them spend it on what they consider most important,” said Sherle Schwenninger, the founder of the World Economic Roundtable and a director at New America, a left-leaning think tank. “There will be some waste and pet projects, but a lot of them will start repairing potholes and replacing water pipes, moving power lines underground, etc.”\n\nPerhaps no issue is more contentious than the scale of an infrastructure package. The topline numbers vary a lot across proposals. Clinton’s plan calls for $250 billion in direct federal spending over five years (with another $25 billion allotted to the creation of a national infrastructure bank — more on that later). Bernie Sanders called for a much bigger plan during his primary campaign: $1 trillion over five years. And Trump has said he would “at least double” Clinton’s package. Republicans in Congress, meanwhile, aren’t exactly happy with this bidding war, so if the GOP retains control of Congress, it’s not clear how big a package the two parties will be able to agree on.\n\nBut how much should it be? Summers said one way to answer that question is to look at total public infrastructure investment (at all levels of government) as a share of the overall economy. By that measure, it looks like the U.S. has been underinvesting in its infrastructure for decades. Gross government investment in structures — taken here as a close approximation to infrastructure — has fallen from a peak of around 3.5 percent of gross domestic product in the late 1950s to 1.5 percent in mid-2016. That is nearly the lowest mark in nearly 70 years. (The historical average is about 2.3 percent of GDP.)\n\nSummers recommends a big boost to infrastructure spending to make up for what he considers years of underinvestment. In an interview, he suggested the U.S. should spend an additional 1 percent of GDP per year for 10 years, in addition to the roughly 1.5 percent of GDP the U.S. spends now. As a result, total spending over the next decade would rise by around $2 trillion — more than either candidate is proposing.\n\nSome experts put the price tag even higher. The American Society of Civil Engineers recommends $3.6 trillion in investment by 2020. ASCE is hardly unbiased: Its members would benefit from increased infrastructure investment. Asked about this potential conflict of interest, Brian Pallasch, the managing director of government relations for ASCE, said: “Engineers are in the best position to comment on this; obviously we know a little bit more about it. You’re not going to a lawyer for a health care checkup.” Although this number may cause sticker shock for some, the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, took ASCE’s “infrastructure gap” seriously enough to outline a scenario of investment to close it.\n\nHistorically, most government infrastructure projects at both the state and federal level have been paid for with borrowed money, via government bonds. Economists often warn about the risks of too much debt. But in this case, some economists see borrowing as an argument in favor of infrastructure spending, not against it.\n\nThis argument is a bit technical, but the short version is this: The U.S. and other rich nations have been stuck in a prolonged period of low economic growth. That pattern, and the low interest rates that come with it, have discouraged private investment — why build a new factory or invest in a new project if you won’t get a decent return on your investment? Infrastructure spending, because it relies on long-term borrowing, would probably drive up interest rates, encouraging more private investment while improving the long-term productive capacity of the U.S. economy. Infrastructure investment, Summers said, “enables us to have more financial stability with the same level of demand at a higher interest rate.”\n\nNot everyone buys Summers’s theory. But even if he is wrong, low interest rates mean that it is remarkably cheap for the U.S. to borrow money right now. That means the government can afford to borrow more than it could during a period of higher interest rates. (Of course, interest rates could always rise.)\n\nMany politicians from both parties, however, are wary of increasing the national debt. Clinton has pledged repeatedly not to “add a penny” to the debt. Trump has likewise pledged not to increase the debt; his advisers argue his plan to use tax credits to spur private infrastructure spending would pay for itself. (Many outside experts are skeptical.)\n\nDemocrats have proposed an alternative financing option called a national infrastructure bank. It would work like this: The federal government provides some initial capital — in the billions of dollars — to establish the bank, which then leverages that money to finance infrastructure projects (done by the public or private sector) at many times that amount. The idea was a key piece of President Obama’s 2014 infrastructure proposal that stalled. Clinton’s plan is to leverage $25 billion in federal funding to enable lending at nearly 10 times that amount.\n\nBut Republicans are likely to oppose such a body. Hennessey, the former Bush advisor, called the idea “terrible.” He thinks an infrastructure bank would become “captured” by the interests that would benefit from government subsidies, leading it to make poor decisions; he cited the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as examples of how it could go wrong.","description":"If there’s one issue that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on, it’s that America’s infrastructure is in need of an upgrade.

That’s up 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the fastest growth since 2009. Non-managers — what the BLS calls “production and non-supervisory employees” — saw their earnings rise a more modest 2.4 percent, but they too are seeing gains that are running well ahead of inflation.\n\nThe strong earnings figures were the highlight of a jobs report — the last major set of economic data before Election Day — that was otherwise solid but not spectacular. U.S. employers added 161,000 jobs in October, a bit below economists’ expectations, but that disappointment was largely offset by upward revisions to August and September’s jobs figures by a combined 44,000 jobs. The unemployment rate, which had risen to 5 percent in September, ticked back down to 4.9 percent.\n\nTaken together, the figures suggest that the long, slow recovery in the job market is moving into a new phase: from job growth to wage growth. For much of the past seven years, economists have focused on putting back to work the millions of Americans who lost jobs during the recession. That process isn’t complete — there are still close to 8 million unemployed Americans and millions more who would like jobs but don’t count as unemployed — but the economy is closer to a healthy level of employment than it has been in years. Hiring is starting to slow: Employers are adding jobs at a pace of about 2.4 million a year, down from more than 3 million in early 2015.\n\nSlower hiring could actually be good news for workers. For much of the recovery, there were far more unemployed workers than available jobs, giving employers little incentive to raise wages. But now, with fewer people out of work, companies are being forced to work harder and pay more to attract and retain talent, and wages are finally rising. Average hourly earnings is a crude measure of compensation, just the total amount workers were paid divided by the number of hours they worked. It doesn’t include the value of benefits or take into account which industries are hiring. But more sophisticated measures that do take such factors into account also show workers making strong gains. And overall household income, which lagged for much of the recovery, rose at the fastest pace on record in 2015.\n\nRising pay and falling unemployment are good news for Hillary Clinton, who has been happy to tie herself to President Obama’s economic legacy. But Friday’s report still had nuggets for Donald Trump as well, such as slowing job growth, particularly in the private sector, and a shrinking labor force. And although overall economic growth picked up in the third quarter of the year, the recovery as a whole remains historically weak. FiveThirtyEight’s forecasting model considers the economy a more or less neutral factor in the presidential race; strong wage growth in October isn’t likely to change many voters’ minds.\n\nHere are a few more observations from Friday’s report:\n\nUnemployment is down for “bad” reasons: The government counts people as unemployed only if they are actively looking for work. That means the unemployment rate can fall for both good reasons (more people found jobs) and bad ones (more people stopped looking). In October, the unemployment rate fell for bad reasons. The labor-force participation rate — the share of adults either working or actively looking for work — fell by a tenth of a percentage point. But it’s wise not to fixate on month-to-month changes in either unemployment or the participation rate, both of which can be volatile. Over the slightly longer run, the unemployment rate has fallen significantly — it was 7.2 percent three years ago — and the participation rate, which fell through the recession and much of the recovery, is showing signs of a modest rebound. Perhaps more significantly, the share of so-called prime-age adults who are working — those ages 25 to 54 — is now the highest it has been since 2008.\n\nMeanwhile, the prospects of job seekers are improving: More than one in four unemployed workers found a job in October. The so-called job-finding rate fell early this year but has since rebounded.\n\nGood jobs, bad jobs: Job growth in October was strongest in relatively high-paying sectors. The professional and business-services sector, which pays more than $31 an hour on average, added 43,000 jobs; health care and education, which pay nearly $26 an hour on average, added 52,000. Job growth was weaker in the lower-paying leisure and hospitality sector, and employment in the retail sector was essentially flat. On the other hand, good-paying blue-collar jobs were scarce in October: The manufacturing and mining industries cut jobs, and construction companies added a relatively paltry 11,000 jobs.\n\nMost of the employment gains over the past year have been in full-time work, a trend that has been consistent throughout the recovery. (The month-to-month numbers are too volatile to mean much.) But nearly 6 million Americans are working part-time because they can’t find full-time work, a figure that has stalled out over the past year.","description":"It may be too late to affect Tuesday’s election, but the economy is finally delivering real wage growth to American workers.

The TPP is the trade deal many thought was already killed off, but it just won’t go away. During the primaries, it served as a policy pinata — with Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, in particular, taking turns excoriating it as a raw deal for American workers. Hillary Clinton, once a supporter, came out against it, too. (She now says the final version of the treaty doesn’t meet her standards.)\n\nBut the Obama administration, which negotiated the treaty, isn’t giving up on it. The White House is pressuring Congress to approve the 12-nation trade deal during the lame-duck session after the election. And on Thursday, Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers published a report warning that if the TPP isn’t passed, a China-backed trade agreement will take its place. That could put U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage when they try to sell to customers in Japan and other Asian nations. The report argues that if China’s Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership goes into effect, at least 35 U.S. industries as diverse as plastics, fishing and footwear will be at risk of increased competition from China in the Japanese market.\n\nNext week’s election will affect the chances of Obama’s TPP Hail Mary. If Trump wins, all bets are off: Republicans, usually more keen to support trade deals than Democrats, aren’t likely to back a deal strongly opposed by the president their party just elected. But if Clinton wins, Obama might be able to put together a coalition of Republicans and trade-friendly Democrats to support the treaty. In other words, the TPP isn’t dead yet.\n\nAndrew Flowers writes about economics and sports for FiveThirtyEight. @andrewflowers","description":"You’re reading Back of the Envelope, an experiment that aims to bring shorter, quicker content to FiveThirtyEight.

As I’ve written repeatedly, the numbers don’t back that up: Immigrants have lower rates of violent crime than native-born Americans, and the number of people entering the country illegally has dropped sharply in recent years. (The total population of undocumented immigrants has been pretty much flat since 2008.)\n\nBut what about Trump’s claim about immigrants taking jobs? A new report from the Pew Research Center suggests that isn’t true either. Using data from the American Community Survey, Pew found that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. workforce has held steady at about 8 million since the recession ended in 2009. As a share of the workforce, the undocumented population has actually shrunk slightly, to 5 percent from 5.4 percent in 2007. (See our story from 2014 for more on how researchers compile these figures.)\n\nBut there’s a reason that Trump’s rhetoric has found an audience. The undocumented workforce may no longer be growing, but it is still high by historical standards. And some U.S. workers, particularly those without a college degree, really do face significant competition from undocumented labor. Undocumented immigrants make up 17 percent of agricultural workers and 13 percent of construction workers. Also, illegal immigration doesn’t hit all parts of the country evenly, as the map below makes clear. As I wrote on Monday, immigration is a key source of economic strength for the U.S., but that doesn’t mean it benefits everyone equally.\n\nImmigration Is Changing Much More Than The Immigration Debate\n\nThe Consequences: A Look Behind The Claims On Immigration\n\nUndocumented Immigrants Aren’t Who You Think They Are\n\nImmigration Isn’t Driving Hispanic Population Growth","description":"You’re reading Back of the Envelope, an experiment that aims to bring shorter, quicker content to FiveThirtyEight.

Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments.\n\nNo matter who wins next Tuesday’s election, the president who takes office next January will be among the oldest ever elected. (Donald Trump, at 70, would be the oldest president ever elected to a first term. Hillary Clinton, who turned 69 last week, would be the second-oldest after Ronald Reagan.) Perhaps that’s appropriate — the country they are hoping to lead is getting older too. When Bill Clinton took office in 1993 at age 46 — making him the third-youngest president ever — 12.6 percent of Americans were at least 65, the traditional retirement age. Today 14.8 percent are. And by 2050, that figure is expected to rise to 22.1 percent.\n\nThe aging of the U.S. population poses major economic challenges: rising healthcare costs, more retirement spending and, crucially, fewer working-age Americans to help pay for it all. Already, economists believe, the graying of America helps explain the slow economic growth of the past decade-plus. The problem will only get worse as more baby boomers leave the workforce.\n\nBut by global standards, the U.S. is in pretty good shape. In parts of Europe, more than 20 percent of the population is of retirement age; in Japan, it is 26 percent. Those countries have the same challenges as the U.S.: a large generation born after World War II that is now at or approaching retirement, and a steep decline in fertility rates. But the U.S. has something they don’t have: a high rate of immigration.\n\nYou wouldn’t know it from this year’s overheated campaign rhetoric, but immigration is the only thing keeping the U.S. from facing a Japan-style demographic cliff. At a time when aging and other factors mean that fewer Americans are working, immigrants — who tend to come to the U.S. during their working years and have a higher rate of labor-force participation than native-born Americans — play an increasingly important role in the U.S. workforce. Foreign-born U.S. residents made up 13.1 percent of the population in 2014 but 16.4 percent of the labor force, up from 10 percent two decades earlier. Immigrants help the economy in other ways too: They are more likely than native-born Americans to start businesses, and because they pay into Social Security but only receive benefits if they stay in the country permanently, they help ease the U.S.’s long-run fiscal burden.\n\nPerhaps just as importantly, immigrants are the reason the U.S. has a relatively high birth rate compared to other rich countries. Americans, like their counterparts in Japan and western Europe, are having fewer children. But that decline has been partly offset by the comparatively high fertility rate among foreign-born residents. A report from the Pew Research Center last week showed just how big that effect is: Immigrants account for the entirety of the increase in the number of annual U.S. births since 1970. Without them, the annual number of births would have declined.\n\nBut while immigration provides the U.S. with important economic advantages, it also poses challenges. The U.S. has experienced a half-century-long wave of immigration; the foreign-born share of the population is on track to hit a record later this century. Past periods of rapid immigration have brought conflict, and the 2016 election suggests that this time will not be different.\n\nSome of that conflict, no doubt, is driven by racism and prejudice. But there are also economic challenges. Foreign-born U.S. residents are, on average, significantly less well-educated than native-born Americans. About 28 percent of immigrants ages 25 and up have less than a high school diploma, compared to 8 percent of native-born Americans. That means they compete for work with the least educated Americans, who already face the greatest challenges finding decent-paying jobs.\n\nMost economists firmly reject the notion that “immigrants are taking our jobs.” By providing new customers as well as new workers, immigration increases income and employment opportunities for native-born workers, leaving everyone better off on average. But the key phrase there is “on average.” There is much less agreement among economists about how low-skilled immigration affects the wages of low-skilled workers. And it is almost certain that some individual American workers are worse off because of competition from immigrants.\n\nIf that dynamic sounds familiar, it might be because it’s very similar to the debate over another major 2016 campaign issue: trade. Trade, like immigration, helps the economy as a whole, but can harm individual workers. In fact, it is largely the same workers: Americans without a college degree. Doctors and lawyers, by and large, don’t have to worry about their jobs being shipped overseas or about being displaced by an immigrant willing to do the work for less. Factory and service workers do.\n\nIn 2014, I wrote that the immigration debate hasn’t kept up with reality — it remains focused on illegal immigration from Mexico, even as illegal immigration has fallen and Asia has overtaken Latin America as a source of new arrivals. Two years later, Trump has pushed the debate even further from the facts, with his baseless claims that immigrants are rapists and criminals. (In fact, immigrants commit violent crimes at a lower rate than native Americans.) But perhaps when the election is over there will at last be an opportunity for an honest discussion of immigration, a critical source of strength for the U.S., but one that also poses serious challenges.\n\nLast week, I reported on new research from economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz that found evidence that financial markets are nervous about a Trump presidency. Friday afternoon’s “October surprise” from the FBI provided an unexpected chance to test that thesis.\n\nIn their paper, Wolfers and Zitzewitz observed that stock prices rose during the first presidential debate, which Clinton was widely seen as winning. Friday provided a similar experiment in reverse: Markets immediately plunged on the news that the FBI was looking into a new cache of emails that could be tied to Clinton’s private server. (Markets later rebounded somewhat as subsequent reporting made the news appear less dire for Clinton.)\n\nThe evidence for the “markets hate Trump” thesis isn’t definitive. It’s possible that investors were spooked by the increased uncertainty around the election outcome, rather than by the possibility that Trump’s prospects might improve. And even if investors do prefer Clinton to Trump, there is no guarantee that a surprise Trump victory would cause a long-term drop in stocks rather than a short-term blip. Still, Friday provided a convenient test of Wolfers’s and Zitzewitz’s theory, and it passed.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release job and unemployment data for October, the last major economic figures before Election Day. The report will probably come too late to have much of an impact on the outcome. But it will at least provide some insight into the economic context in which voters are making their choice.\n\nEconomists expect the report to show that the economy added 178,000 jobs in October, which would represent a modest pickup from September, when employers added an estimated 156,000 jobs. (That figure will also be updated on Friday.) More generally, it would represent a continuation of the recent pattern of solid but unspectacular job growth. That is consistent with last Friday’s report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis that showed that gross domestic product increased at a 2.9 percent rate in the third quarter. That marked a significant pickup from the first half of the year, and beat economists’ expectations. But economists cautioned that the report didn’t suggest a sustained acceleration in economic growth.\n\nAT\u0026T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner is already raising antitrust concerns. On Tuesday, I argued it also points to a larger issue in the U.S. economy: the increasing dominance of big corporations. (That dominance could also be bad for workers.)\n\nIn last week’s column, I interviewed Laurence Kotlikoff, an economist running a long-shot bid for the presidency. In a blog post on Monday, Kotlikoff took issue with some of my analysis.\n\nAre you a college student? Do you enjoy FiveThirtyEight’s economics coverage?

(On the other hand, simple probabilities mean a recession is more likely than not, Josh Zumbrun writes in The Wall Street Journal.)\n\nTyler Cowen is one of several prominent economists who has written favorably about the idea of providing a “universal basic income” to all Americans.

It could be bad for workers, too — and the White House is taking notice.\n\nBusiness consolidation isn’t inherently bad for workers. Big corporations tend to pay better than smaller ones, and they tend to offer more generous benefits. But if consolidation leads to less competition between companies, that can reduce workers’ bargaining power and lead to slower wage growth. A new report from the president’s Council of Economic Advisers argues that’s exactly what is happening. The report notes that the share of national income that goes to workers (as opposed to business owners) has been falling for two decades, and points to the increasing dominance of big businesses as a key cause.\n\nOne area of particular concern: the spread of noncompete agreements, which make it harder for workers to seek better wages at another employer (an issue the CEA highlighted in an earlier report). The White House on Tuesday announced a new effort to collect better data on noncompete agreements, and it called on states to crack down on their use.","description":"You’re reading Back of the Envelope, an experiment that aims to bring shorter, quicker content to FiveThirtyEight.

Donald Trump and Sens. Tim Kaine, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken all either raised questions about the merger or outright called for the government to block it. Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who lead the Senate’s antitrust subcommittee, promised to hold hearings on the deal. In the coming months, we’ll hear lots more about vertical versus horizontal integration, market concentration and the implications of consolidation in the media industry.\n\nBut beyond the specific questions raised by the deal itself, the proposed merger points to a broader issue: The U.S. economy is increasingly dominated by big companies. That trend worries a growing number of economists, who fear it suggests an economy that is becoming less dynamic and competitive over time.\n\nIn the late 1980s, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, about 40 percent of American workers were employed by companies with at least 1,000 employees. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, that figure had risen to 46 percent. That may sound like a small change, but in the context of the entire U.S. economy — tens of millions of people working for millions of companies — it represents a massive shift. Since 1977, the earliest year for which data is available, the number of large companies (those with at least 1,000 employees) has doubled; small companies (those with fewer than 50 workers) have increased by only about half.\n\nAmerican companies aren’t just getting bigger; they’re getting older, too. About 68 percent of U.S. employees work for companies that have been in business for 20 years or more, up from 59 percent 20 years earlier, according to census data. Meanwhile, the startup rate — the share of U.S. companies that are less than a year old — has been falling for more than 30 years.\n\nThose statistics push back against the narrative that incumbent companies are increasingly facing the threat of “disruption” from Silicon Valley upstarts. There are examples of genuine disruption — what Uber is doing to the taxi industry right now, for example. But overall, the evidence suggests that big, established companies enjoy more advantages than ever. The rate at which established companies fail has fallen since the 1980s, while fewer startups are surviving and growing. And in most industries, the share of total revenue earned by the 50 biggest companies has risen over the past 15 years, according to an April report from the president’s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMuch of the early scrutiny of the proposed AT\u0026T merger has focused on what it means for consumers: Will it lead to higher prices for broadband internet? Will it allow AT\u0026T to give preferential treatment to Time Warner content, like CNN or HBO? Or will it make it easier for consumers to access content across different devices?\n\nBut the broader trend of corporate consolidation matters for more than just consumers. It suggests that the economy as a whole has become less dynamic and flexible. Startups, in particular, are a key source of innovation in the economy — they generate new ideas, which force existing companies to adapt or risk failure. That process, repeated thousands of times, makes the economy as a whole more productive. The falling startup rate, combined with the rise of big businesses, suggests that this process has somehow broken down.\n\nEconomists aren’t sure what is behind the trends, and it can be hard to separate cause and effect. It’s possible that deals like AT\u0026T’s (and Verizon’s acquisitions of AOL and, if it goes through, Yahoo) are part of the problem — an effort by big companies to gain even more market control and political clout so that they can muscle out would-be competitors. (Recent research has found, not surprisingly, that mergers tend to increase prices but not improve efficiency.) But the mergers could also be a symptom, a sign that other forces — globalization, slower economic growth or increased regulation, among others — are forcing companies to get bigger to survive. Either way, the continued trend of corporate consolidation is a troubling sign for an economy stuck in a prolonged pattern of weak growth.","description":"Almost as soon as word leaked out Friday about AT\u0026T’s plan to buy Time Warner (the companies formally announced the deal late Saturday), politicians from bo…","keywords":"","time":1477400217,"url":"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/atts-merger-could-be-a-bad-sign-for-the-economy/"},{"title":"Meet The Economist Running For President","body":"This is In Real Terms, a weekly column analyzing the latest economic news. Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments.\n\n“I’m fully prepared not to become president of the United States,” Laurence Kotlikoff told me, more than an hour into a telephone interview Saturday. “That could happen.”\n\nWell, that’s a relief. At least we won’t have two losing presidential candidates challenging the results of the election two weeks from Tuesday. But let’s be honest: You probably weren’t lying awake at night worrying about how Kotlikoff will react if he loses. You probably didn’t even know he was running.\n\nKotlikoff is a Harvard-trained economist, a Boston University professor and, yes, a candidate for president. He is on the ballot in only two states (Louisiana and Colorado), but he is eligible to win as a write-in candidate in most of the others, meaning that unlike, say, Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence, he could theoretically be elected president Nov. 8.\n\nEmphasis, of course, on “theoretically.” In reality, Kotlikoff has effectively zero chance of winning, not least because he has little name recognition and no serious strategy for changing that. (More about that in a moment.) But long-shot though he may be, Kotlikoff is not a crank. He’s a respected and — within academic circles — well-known economist with legitimate credentials and serious ideas.\n\nThe animating principle behind Kotlikoff’s campaign is simple: Today’s Americans are running up a huge bill — both literal and figurative — and leaving the next generation to pay it. On fiscal policy, Kotlikoff thinks that official government budget estimates vastly understate the future cost of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. On foreign relations, Kotlikoff argues that by letting North Korea develop nuclear weapons, the U.S. is leaving a far less secure world for future generations. And on climate change, Kotlikoff believes not only that the U.S. is failing to take the threat seriously, but also that many well-intentioned policies are making the problem worse.\n\n“We’re not disclosing honestly the burdens that we’re leaving for our kids,” Kotlikoff said. “I don’t think we can just leave our kids at risk.”\n\nKotlikoff is known among economists for what is called “generational accounting,” which is the idea that the government should evaluate policies based on how they will affect spending and revenue far into the future — much further than the 10-year budget window that is standard now. For example, the government has promised to pay Social Security benefits for Americans working today; paying those benefits will fall to the next generation of Americans, yet that obligation doesn’t show up on the government’s balance sheet. Kotlikoff estimates that if we account for the full cost of all the government’s long-term obligations, projected out into the distant future, the true “fiscal gap” between what we owe and what we collect in tax revenue is about $200 trillion, more than 15 times the official national debt.\n\nKotlikoff’s approach has plenty of critics, who argue that generational accounting is hard to interpret and requires looking much further into the future than is realistically possible. (Economists struggle to predict what will happen next month, let alone 100 years from now.) But the idea also has prominent backers. A 2013 bill requiring the government to provide generational accounting estimates drew the backing of hundreds of economists, including 17 Nobel laureates, and was sponsored by, among others, Sen. Tim Kaine, now Hillary Clinton’s running mate.\n\nSome of Kotlikoff’s other ideas likewise have mainstream backing in economics, if not in politics. He wants to overhaul the tax code to tax spending rather than income, which he argues would make it harder for the rich to avoid taxes while eliminating provisions that can discourage the poor from working more. He wants to institute a tax on carbon to fight climate change. And he wants to replace existing tax credits with a lump-sum payment for every American, an idea that, in various forms, has been drawing increased attention from researchers on the left and the right.\n\nSome of Kotlikoff’s other ideas are less mainstream. He wants to limit legal immigration because he believes it is pushing down wages for low-skilled American workers and contributing to a “population explosion” that could lead to overcrowded cities. (He sees illegal immigration as a relatively small problem.) “Boston will turn into Manila,” he said, referring to the Philippines’ capital, which is among the world’s most densely populated cities. His stance on immigration is an odd position for someone worried about the long-term costs of Social Security and other programs; most economists see immigration as a crucial way of supplementing the workforce as U.S. birth rates fall. (Kotlikoff has laid out all of his proposals in a 158-page policy book available on his website.)\n\nAcademics of Kotlikoff’s pedigree usually try to influence policy from inside the system, not by running for president. Kotlikoff said he has tried the conventional approach, testifying before Congress, serving as a consultant for various agencies and foreign governments, and working at Ronald Reagan’s Council of Economic Advisers early in his career. But he said he has become convinced that politicians will never embrace the kind of policies he believes the U.S. needs. (He may be right — Kotlikoff’s proposals include such political nonstarters as cutting Social Security and eliminating Medicare.)\n\n“I’m talking about radical reform,” Kotlikoff said. “We’re not going to get radical reform unless we have a president of the United States who pushes for radical reform.”\n\nKotlikoff swears he is not running merely to spread his ideas — he wants to win. But if that’s true, he isn’t doing much to make it happen. He has essentially no paid staff, has run no television ads and doesn’t hold campaign rallies. His campaign appears to consist mostly of emailing journalists and complaining that they are ignoring him — which, apart from a few stories when he first declared his candidacy, we mostly have. “I expected a whole lot more press,” Kotlikoff told me.\n\nStill, Kotlikoff remains convinced that there is still time for his campaign to “go viral.” He said he hoped people would read this story, visit his website, then pass his message on. That, in the end, may be Kotlikoff’s most radical belief: that in an election year dominated by personal attacks and campaign theatrics — not to mention deep mistrust of experts and elites — policy proposals will carry the day.\n\nLast week, I argued that economists should stop saying that a Donald Trump victory would cause a meltdown in financial markets. Markets are inherently unpredictable, and economists risk undermining their (already shaky) public reputation if they make dire predictions that turn out to be wrong.\n\nBut in a new paper, economists at the Brookings Institution argue that investors are sending a clear signal that they are rooting against a Trump presidency. Economists Justin Wolfers and Eric Zitzewitz looked at how markets moved during the first presidential debate, which pretty much everyone scored as a decisive win for Clinton. They found that stock prices rose and volatility fell, both signs that markets were comforted by the improved prospects of a Clinton victory. They observed a similar pattern over the early October weekend that followed the release of the now-infamous “hot mic” videotape that was widely seen as hurting Trump’s chances.\n\nWolfers and Zitzewitz’s work still doesn’t necessarily mean markets will tumble if Trump wins, or, if they do, that the losses will last long. (Markets fell sharply after the surprise “Brexit” decision but have since rebounded.) But their findings do represent a break from history: In most elections dating back more than a century, markets have appeared to prefer the Republican candidate.\n\nWe will get one last pre-election jobs report on Nov. 4, four days before voters go to the polls. But last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its final look at state-by-state jobs numbers before Election Day. The report showed the job market improving in many key battleground states.\n\nFlorida — the most likely “tipping-point” state according to FiveThirtyEight’s election model — saw its unemployment rate drop to 4.7 percent in September from 5.1 percent a year ago and from more than 11 percent in the aftermath of the recession. North Carolina, another key swing state, saw the biggest year-over-year improvement in its unemployment rate of any competitive state, to 4.7 percent from 5.7 percent. Michigan, Nevada and Arizona — three of the states hit hardest by the recession and all states that could be important on Election Day — have all seen big declines in their unemployment rates. (One key state, Pennsylvania, isn’t so lucky: Unemployment there fell below 5 percent in 2015 but has since risen sharply.)\n\nInterestingly, Trump doesn’t seem to be outperforming Clinton in states with higher unemployment rates, or in those where the economy has recovered more slowly. If anything, Clinton is doing slightly better than expected in states where the unemployment rate has improved more slowly.\n\nOn Friday, the government will release its preliminary estimate for economic growth in the third quarter of the year, which ended in September. Economists expect it to show that gross domestic product — the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy — rose at a rate of about 2.5 percent. That would represent a marked improvement from the first and second quarters of the year, when GDP grew at rates of 0.8 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively. But it would still leave 2016 on track to be yet another disappointment in a recovery that has been full of them.\n\nNo matter what Friday’s report says, however, don’t read too much into it. The government’s initial estimate of GDP is based on preliminary data and is notoriously unreliable. Better to wait a month or two for the more trustworthy revised data.\n\nThe third and final presidential debate finally put policy front and center, with a particular emphasis on economic issues. See our wrap-up of the policy discussion or check out our full live blog. Or see our pre-debate briefing book for analysis of some of the key issues.\n\nIkea’s Poäng chair is ubiquitous. It is also, remarkably, getting cheaper. Oliver Roeder took a look at the weird economics of the Swedish furniture giant.\n\nFor all the talk of the death of American manufacturing, actual U.S. factory output is near record highs. But in an interview with Jared Bernstein in The Washington Post, economist Susan Houseman argues that those figures are misleading.\n\nThe rapid rise in student debt has hit blacks much harder than whites, Josh Mitchell reports in The Wall Street Journal. According to new research from the Brookings Institution, African-Americans owe nearly twice as much four years after graduation as their white counterparts.\n\nWorried by a new survey showing that a large share of Americans don’t trust government data, economist Claudia Sahm considers possible causes of that mistrust.\n\nAmericans are starting fewer companies.

The home furnishing company uses 1 percent of the planet’s lumber, it says, and the 530 million cubic feet of wood used to make Ikea furniture each year pulls with its own kind of twisted gravity. For many, a sojourn to the enormous blue-and-yellow store winds up defining the space in which they sit, cook, eat and sleep.\n\nAll that wood is turned into furniture that tries to bring a spare, modern aesthetic to the masses. “We’re talking about democratizing design,” Marty Marston, a product public relations manager at Ikea, told me.\n\nThe furniture is also sold according to some unique economics. In many cases, Ikea’s famously affordable pieces get dramatically cheaper year after year. In others, prices creep up. In some cases, products disappear entirely. The result is an ever-evolving, survival-of-the-fittest catalog that wields an enormous amount of influence over residential interiors.\n\nAs we tour Ikea’s unique economics, you may want to have a seat in the company’s Poäng chair, 1.5 million of which are sold each year. Ikea’s been hawking them around the world for the past four decades, taking over living room square footage and modern design sensibilities with just a hex wrench and some wordless instructions.\n\nThe Poäng’s midcentury-modern forebear was the Finnish designer Alvar Aalto’s 1939 creation called simply armchair 406, which had its own bent-birch frame, swooping arms and thin tan upholstery. The Poäng’s design was first sold decades later, in 1978, after a collaboration between Lars Engman and Noboru Nakamura. Nakamura, in a company brochure celebrating his chair’s 40th anniversary, said that even though trends and fashion influence what he designs, “all products should have a timeless value.”\n\nBut it’s less the fashion trends than the resulting furniture economics that make this particular history interesting. Versions of the Aalto sell online for over $4,000. The Poäng debuted at a fraction of the price of the Aalto, and now, after a steep price decline, the Poäng sells at a fraction of its original price. Furniture has generally gotten cheaper relative to other goods over the years — likely due to effects of globalization — but this chair’s trend stands out. In the early 1990s, the chair couldn’t be had for less than $300, adjusted for inflation. Today, it’s $79. (The average piece of $300 dollar furniture in 1990 would cost about $151 today, per the consumer price index for furniture and bedding.)\n\nI was inspired to browse old Ikea catalogs and prices after seeing the iconic Poäng — bent birch, swooping arms, thin tan upholstery — in an ’80s movie. Or so I thought. After a few rewinds, however, I realized I’d made an embarrassing mistake. I had been looking at the Aalto 406 all along. It wasn’t only lumber purchases that Ikea had come to dominate, but also my internal aesthetic compass. What isn’t Ikea becomes Ikea, and what is Ikea becomes everything.\n\nOther Ikea mainstays have followed Poäng’s path, plummeting in price as the years pass. The warhorse Lack table, for example, sold for $25 in 1985 ($56 in current dollars) but goes for just $10 today. Iterations of the Billy bookcases have seen big drops, as well.\n\nBut it’s not as simple as saying that everything in the 1988 Ikea catalog has gotten radically cheaper over time. The full story is, as full stories always are, subtler. Anthony Landry, a research adviser at the Bank of Canada, and Marianne Baxter, an economist at Boston University, have studied swaths of data culled from old Ikea catalogs and how they reflect economic concepts — exchange-rate pass-through and the law of one price, for example. Baxter, who loves midcentury-modern designs such as Aalto’s, shared some slices of that data with me, and we discussed the phenomena she and Landry spotted within it. In addition to the steadily decreasing prices of much of the product line, the researchers also identified Ikea’s tendency to constantly modify its menu of products and varieties.\n\n“I think this is a pattern for products that survive for a long time,” Baxter said of the steep price drops. “Basically, they won’t survive unless they’re cost effective. I think the economies of scale really kicked in for that chair.”\n\nEven Ikea employees told me they marvel at the declines. “We pulled out a 1985 catalog, and we started looking at products,” Marston said. “It was really fun for us to say, ‘Oh my God, look at the price of that. Look how expensive it was when we first came here to this country.’”\n\nAlthough Baxter can’t yet prove its particulars — more data cleaning and analysis is necessary for her ultimate Ikea project — there is a sort of evolutionary dynamic at play in the annual Ikea catalog: survival of the fittest furniture. She noticed that the company tends to discontinue products that remain expensive. “If they can’t figure out how to make them more cheaply, or retool them or slightly redesign them, it seems like the things disappear,” she said.\n\nIndeed, the products have evolved. In 1992, part of the Poäng was changed from steel to wood, allowing the chair to ship more densely and efficiently in the company’s flat packs. (“Shipping air is very expensive,” Marston said.) And the Lack table was changed from solid wood to a honeycomb “board on frame” construction, decreasing production costs and increasing shipping efficiency. Baxter theorizes, though, that if a product is finicky — requiring design in Sweden, manufacture in China and intricate pieces from Switzerland, say — it may eventually be abandoned.\n\nMarston thought the Darwinian idea was interesting, but that the deletions from the catalog were less about persistently high prices and more about popularity. “If a product doesn’t perform well — we have certain sales expectations — then it will cease to exist. The public didn’t like it for some reason, so why continue to sell it?” she said.\n\nNot all Ikea chairs have seen Poäng’s stark downward trend in price. The Antilop highchair (Swedish for “antelope”), for example, saw price decreases in a few international markets during the 1990s, but prices remained flat or increased, including in the U.S., in many cases after that. Baxter illustrated this example in the chart below:\n\nBut, indeed, the highchair is still being sold — it’s not yet extinct.\n\nMore generally, there is another common pattern in Ikea pricing. “If they’re going to increase the price, they do it by little bits all the time,” Baxter told me. “But if they’re going to decrease the price, those decreases tend to be big and noticeable, and they get advertised.”\n\nMarston echoed this empirical finding. “On average, the prices would go down, from year to year, 1 percent overall,” she said. “Some prices could go down with a huge jump. Other prices may increase slightly. But overall, year on year on year on year, we’re trying to reduce prices.”\n\nSome mysteries persist. One is the company’s international pricing discrepancies. “They’ll sometimes reduce prices in the United States and make them go up in Canada, which makes even Canadians mad,” Baxter said. (The horror.) Marston said each country has “its own unique competition profile” that influences how the company prices its goods.\n\nSome of these oddities may be explained by one principle: Ikea is sui generis — in a class by itself. The company navigates largely uncharted waters for traditional economic strictures. “Ikea continues to be nearly unique,” Baxter said. “I would’ve told you that they would have competitors all over the place by now, 15 years ago. I would’ve been horribly wrong. There’s only them.”","description":"Ikea is a behemoth.

Oh, sure, the post-debate headlines focused on Donald Trump’s refusal to promise that he would accept the results of next month’s vote. And there were still plenty of interruptions and heated exchanges. But in between the barbs, the candidates held what was without a doubt their most substantive debate yet.\n\nSome of the ground the candidates covered was familiar: taxes, the economy, nuclear policy and the war in Syria. But Trump and Hillary Clinton also spent time on issues that had until now been largely ignored, including abortion, the national debt and, most significantly, immigration — a defining issue during the campaign, but one that had barely been mentioned in the previous two debates. On the other hand, climate change was still missing in action, meaning we will have gone through every general election debate without the candidates being asked about what many experts say will be one of the most critical issues facing the next president.\n\nFor the full rundown of what the candidates discussed, check out our live blog. But here are a few highlights from the major policy debates of the evening.\n\nTrump: “We’re a country of laws. We either have a border or we don’t. Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen, but it’s very unfair — we have millions of people that did it the right way. They’re on line, they’re waiting. … Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen.”\n\nClinton: “I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly. And that’s why I’m introducing immigration reform within the first hundred days with a path to citizenship…. Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them in the formal economy will be good because then employers can’t exploit them and undercut Americans’ wages.”\n\nImmigration was the elephant in the room in the first two debates, the huge campaign issue that somehow barely came up. Even before Wednesday night’s debate, it was clear that the elephant would finally be acknowledged — immigration was one of the debate’s six pre-announced topics.\n\nInitially, the two candidates stuck more or less to their expected talking points. Trump promised to build a wall on the U.S.’s southern border — although he didn’t mention his plan to make Mexico pay for it — and he hit on a familiar theme linking undocumented immigrants to violent crime. (There is no evidence that immigrants, including undocumented immigrants, are more dangerous than native-born Americans. If anything, research has found immigrants commit violent crimes at a lower rate.) “We have some bad hombres here, and we’re going to get them out,” Trump said at one point. Clinton, meanwhile, agreed that border security is necessary but emphasized her support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers and argued that a more forgiving approach is better not just for immigrants but for native-born workers as well.\n\nBut a few minutes into the immigration discussion, an interesting shift took place: Each candidate seemed to try to claim the other’s strongest position. Clinton criticized Trump for allegedly employing undocumented workers on his construction projects, which she said drove down American wages. (The research on that claim is mixed.) And Trump noted that President Obama has deported millions of undocumented immigrants. (That’s true. Obama, despite his executive actions offering legal status to some undocumented workers who arrived in the U.S. as children, has deported more people than George W. Bush.) “She doesn’t want to say that, but that’s what’s happened,” Trump said of Obama’s deportations.\n\nTrump: “I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that would go back to the individual states. … And [overturning Roe v. Wade will] happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court.”\n\nClinton: “I have met with women who, toward the end of their pregnancy, get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.”\n\nAfter immigration, perhaps the most striking absence from the first two debates (sorry, Gary Johnson) was discussion of social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. In past presidential races, such issues took center stage, but they have drawn little attention this year. (They got a bit more attention during the Republican primary, when “religious liberty” became a stand-in for same-sex marriage during the debates.)\n\nEarlier this year, Trump drew heat for suggesting that women who get abortions should face “some form of punishment.” He avoided repeating that phrase on Wednesday, instead taking a more traditional conservative tack of promising to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. But Trump also described late-term abortions in graphic terms, saying Clinton wanted to let pregnant women “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day.” (Virtually all abortions are performed before the 21st week of pregnancy; doctors do not perform them in the ninth month.)\n\nClinton stressed that most late-term abortions occur only when women discover fetal abnormalities, which she called “often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make.” But Clinton didn’t go as far as many modern advocates, who in recent years have tried to destigmatize abortion. Clinton, who once called for abortion to be “safe, legal and rare,” has since shifted her tone, offering a more forceful defense of abortion rights. But she still framed abortion as a difficult decision, albeit one that should nearly always be left up to women to make. “This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make,” Clinton said, “and I do not believe the government should be making it.”\n\nClinton: “I pay for everything I’m proposing. I do not add a penny to the national debt. … So when I talk about how we’re going to pay for education, how we’re going to invest in infrastructure, how we’re going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I’ve made it very clear, we are going where the money is. We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth.”\n\nTrump: “We’re bringing [growth in gross domestic product] from 1 percent up to 4 percent. And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent. I think you could go to to 5 or 6 percent. … We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again. To do that, we’re taking back jobs. We’re not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs.”\n\nThe real winner of Wednesday night’s debate may have been neither Clinton nor Trump but rather the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an advocacy group that promotes policies that reduce the federal budget deficit. Moderator Chris Wallace referenced the group twice, and framed an entire section of the debate around its core issue. (The vice presidential debate likewise featured questions focused on the debt, drawing criticism from liberal groups.)\n\nWallace described the rising debt as a “problem,” but that’s far from a unanimous position among economists. U.S. debt is high by historical standards — it grew rapidly early in Obama’s term due to a combination of stimulus package and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but its growth rate has since slowed — but most economists think the U.S. can safely borrow more without damaging the economy (they disagree about how much more). And with interest rates low (making it cheaper to borrow money) and the economy still recovering from the Great Recession, many liberal economists think the U.S. should be borrowing more, not less.\n\nNeither candidate challenged Wallace’s framing of the question, however. Clinton repeated her pledge not to “add a penny to the national debt,” by which she presumably meant she would not increase the debt beyond current projections — otherwise she would have to immediately close the government’s $590 billion budget deficit, a move that would almost certainly throw the U.S. into a recession. Clinton’s tax plan would raise government revenues by $1.4 trillion over the next decade, according to an analysis from the Tax Policy Center, with virtually all of the extra money coming from the richest 1 percent of Americans. But she would spend essentially all of that extra revenue on various policy priorities such as debt-free college, leaving her overall plan revenue-neutral.\n\nTrump’s tax plan, meanwhile, would add trillions to the deficit under even the most favorable assumptions. Wallace questioned Trump on the issue, asking him why he (and Clinton) were “ignoring the problem,” but Trump largely avoided the question, implying that his plans would boost economic growth so much that deficits would disappear. That’s a claim that virtually no serious economist finds credible. For one thing, presidents have relatively little control over the short-term direction of the economy. And while it’s true that economic growth has been disappointing in recent years, few economists think that sustained growth of 4 percent per year — let alone 5 or 6 percent growth — is realistic at a time when the population is aging and population growth is slow. Ironically, one way Trump might be able to boost growth would be to increase the population by letting in more immigrants, something he seems unlikely to do.\n\nClinton: “I support the Second Amendment. … I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership. It goes back to the founding of our country. But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation.”\n\nTrump: “In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city. So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence.”\n\nTrump didn’t emphasize crime as much in Wednesday night’s debate as he did in the first contest, when he said Chicago resembled a “war-torn country.” But he called out Chicago’s violence during an early exchange over guns, and returned to the issue of crime in his closing statement when he said inner cities are a “disaster” and that “you get shot walking to the store.”\n\nTrump is right that gun violence is on the rise in the U.S. Murders rose sharply in 2015, and preliminary data indicates the increase has continued in 2016, although the growth rate appears to have slowed somewhat. Chicago has been hit particularly hard; as of early October, the city had seen a 42 percent increase in murder over the same period in 2015. But in other ways, Trump’s apocalyptic vision is misleading. Other forms of violent crime are up much less than murder, and homicide rates remain far below their 1990s levels. Moreover, as Simone Sebastian wrote in The Washington Post after the last debate, Trump’s frequent use of “inner city” as a synonym for “black” is badly outdated: More African-Americans now live in the suburbs than in the city.\n\nClinton focused specifically on gun violence, referring repeatedly to the 33,000 Americans who die by firearm each year. She didn’t mention that close to two-thirds of those deaths are suicides, instead choosing to emphasize homicide and tragic accidents involving toddlers. (Accidents make up a small share of gun deaths and, as my colleague Maggie Koerth-Baker wrote earlier this year, are surprisingly difficult to define.)\n\nClinton said she supported the Second Amendment, including the individual right to bear arms (although she said she disagreed with the Supreme Court’s D.C. v. Heller decision, which definitively established that right for the first time). But she called for “reasonable” gun restrictions, including universal background checks. Research in Missouri and Connecticut has found that a particularly strict version of background checks, known as permit-to-purchase laws, reduces gun homicides and suicides. But other restrictions that Clinton supports, such as bans on some types of assault weapons, are less well-grounded in scientific research.","description":"After two debates dominated by personal attacks and overheated rhetoric, the issues returned to center stage last night.

Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments.\n\nBillionaire investor Mark Cuban says a Donald Trump victory would cause the stock market to “tank.” The forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers says stocks would fall 8 percent if he wins. Economists at Citigroup go even further: They say a Trump win could cause a “global recession.”\n\nEnough already. There are plenty of reasons to think that many of Trump’s policy proposals would harm the economy. But confidently predicting how his mere election would affect markets or the economy is impossible — and risks further undermining economists’ already shaky reputation with the public.\n\nLet’s start with the question of whether a Trump victory would cause stocks to drop. It’s certainly possible. Markets, as pundits endlessly remind us, hate uncertainty — and Trump, because he is such an unusual candidate, would bring a lot of uncertainty. A Trump win would also be a big surprise — FiveThirtyEight’s election models give him around a 15 percent chance of victory — which makes a dramatic market reaction more likely. (In investing jargon, markets haven’t “priced in” a Trump victory.) There is some evidence that markets view Trump warily: Economist Justin Wolfers recently found that the S\u0026P 500 index appeared to rally in response to Trump’s weak performance in the first presidential debate (which made his chances of winning fall). Macroeconomic Advisers’ dire prediction was based on an analysis of the relationship between stock prices and FiveThirtyEight’s election forecast.\n\nAnother analysis from Moody’s Analytics, however, found no clear relationship between market prices and Trump’s chances. And it isn’t hard to come up with arguments for why a Trump presidency could be good for markets. He wants to cut corporate taxes and eliminate regulations, both of which should be good for corporate profits, at least in the short term.\n\nSo it’s possible that a Trump win could cause a crash. Or that it could cause a market rally. Or, perhaps most likely, that there could be little market response at all beyond a few days of volatility. (Historically, U.S. presidential elections haven’t had much impact on the markets.) Be skeptical of any economist who claims to know for sure.\n\nWhat about the effect on the broader economy? Citigroup’s economists argued that a Trump win would create much more uncertainty about government policy, which would lead to tighter financial conditions — banks would become less willing to lend and investors less willing to take risks. That, in turn, would be enough to “trigger a significant slowdown” in this country and around the world.\n\nAll of that is plausible but far from certain. Economists have only recently begun to develop ways to estimate the effect of “policy uncertainty” on the economy; the field isn’t nearly advanced enough to make confident assertions about how a single event like an election surprise would affect the global economy. More generally, the dismal science’s record of forecasting recessions is, well, dismal. Few economists saw the global financial crisis coming (despite what were, in retrospect, numerous warning signs); on the other hand, economists are famous for predicting recessions that never occur. The same Citigroup team that’s forecasting doom from a Trump victory has for more than a year been predicting a global recession triggered by China.\n\nThe risk is that by making confident predictions about inherently unpredictable outcomes, experts will erode their credibility even in areas where their forecasts are on sounder footing. For a case study, look across the Atlantic, where economists made similarly dire predictions about what would happen if the U.K. voted to leave the European Union. Sure enough, markets tanked in the immediate aftermath of the “Brexit” vote. Since then, however, markets have rebounded, and the major British stock indexes are above their pre-Brexit levels. The British economy as a whole, meanwhile, has held up well since the vote; the unemployment rate actually fell in the first post-Brexit report, and other indicators have been similarly positive. Economists, predictably, have taken a beating in the press: “The real casualty of Brexit,” MarketWatch columnist Matthew Lynn wrote in August, is “the reputations of economists who predicted doom.”\n\nBritain hasn’t yet left the European Union, so economists could still prove right about the long-term effects of the Brexit decision. But in the weeks leading up the vote, they didn’t talk about the damage as something that would happen gradually over a period of years. They gave the impression the impact would be swift and severe.\n\nEconomists don’t have to sit the election out. Trump has proposed sweeping — if often non-specific — changes to U.S. policy on taxes, trade and immigration. Those changes would have major economic effects, and unlike short-term market reactions, they are the kind of effects that economists are reasonably good at modeling. Some economists who have analyzed Trump’s proposals have concluded that his trade policies, in particular, could cause a recession. Those predictions aren’t a sure thing — economics never is — but they are on much firmer ground than claims about the immediate aftermath of November’s vote.\n\nSpeaking of Trump’s economic policies, a new analysis from the Tax Policy Center last week found that his tax plan would reduce government revenue by $6.2 trillion over the next decade, and $15.1 trillion over the next two. (The bill is even higher if you count the interest on all that extra debt – although Trump says he would cut spending to avoid further borrowing.) The TPC, a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, estimates the average taxpayer would owe nearly $3,000 less per year under Trump’s plan. But the cuts wouldn’t be evenly distributed. The richest 0.1 percent of earners would pay more than $1 million less per year on average, a 14 percent tax cut. The poorest fifth of households would save $110, a cut of less than 1 percent. Meanwhile, some households, particularly single parents and families with a large number of children, would see their taxes go up.\n\nThe TPC also analyzed Hillary Clinton’s plan, which looks very different. Her plan would raise taxes by $1.4 trillion over the next decade, with nearly all of that coming from the richest 1 percent. Most low- and middle-income households would see a small tax cut. Clinton’s plan would add various deductions, credits and other new provisions, however, making the overall tax code more complex. Most economists would prefer to go the other direction, making the tax code simpler in order to minimize the economic distortions taxes can cause.\n\nAs I’ve written before, analyzing tax policies is more art than science. And in this case, experts not only disagree about the effects of candidates’ tax policies, they aren’t even sure what the candidates are proposing. The TPC’s analysts note that Trump’s proposal “leaves many important details unspecified,” forcing them to make numerous assumptions. (Clinton’s plan has fewer question marks.) But there is little question about the big picture: Clinton wants to raise taxes on the rich. Trump wants to cut them massively.\n\nOne of the hottest topics in economics right now is how app-based platforms such as Uber and Airbnb are affecting the labor market. Fans of the so-called “gig economy” (a poorly defined term) see it as providing flexibility to both workers and customers. Critics worry it could undermine more traditional employer-employee relationships and the protections they provide. But the debate has been severely hampered by a lack of good data. Most gig workers aren’t employees, so they don’t show up in many of the usual sources of job statistics; but they aren’t exactly companies, either, so they aren’t necessarily captured by measures of entrepreneurship.\n\nA new report from the Brookings Institution, however, argues that better data has been under our noses the whole time. A relatively obscure government dataset, the Census Bureau’s nonemployer statistics, has information on businesses that don’t have employees — including self-employed independent contractors such as Uber drivers. By looking at two industries that are most associated with the gig economy, for-hire rides (think Uber) and traveler accommodation (think Airbnb), economists Ian Hathaway and Mark Muro argue they can get a reasonable estimate for the scale and growth of this new type of work.\n\nHathaway and Muro find that Uber, Airbnb and their competitors are growing rapidly, especially in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. But at least so far, the rise of these gig companies hasn’t led to a major drop in more traditional employment. That’s good news for Uber and its fans, but the authors stress that their work is preliminary and that the companies’ impact could grow over time.\n\nThe nonemployer data isn’t perfect. It won’t help measure gig work in categories that aren’t as easy to define by industry, such as the odd jobs performed by users of Taskrabbit. And it doesn’t have demographic or other information on gig workers. But it helps fill in at least some of the gaps in our understanding of this fast-growing and controversial sector.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the presidential candidates will meet in Las Vegas for their third and final debate. According to the topics released by the Commission on Presidential Debates last week, economic issues will play a starring role. Three of the six 15-minute segments will be related to the economy: one on debt and entitlements, one on immigration (a topic that was surprisingly absent from the first two debates) and one on the economy more generally. Later this week, we will be updating our “briefing book” on the major policy issues in the campaign.\n\nWriting for Politico, Dana Goldstein looks at the battle over affordable housing in the Clintons’ home town of Chappaqua, New York.\n\nOne group that’s solidly backing Trump over Clinton: people who still live near where they grew up. Andrew McGill delves into the data in The Atlantic.\n\nWal-Mart, known for its low pay, is raising wages in a bid to attract better employees. Neil Irwin of The New York Times says Wal-Mart’s bet represents a $2.7 billion test of the economic theory of “efficiency wages.”\n\nInequality isn’t just rising among individuals. It’s rising among companies, too. That complicates the debate over what’s causing the rise in income inequality, reports Josh Zumbrun in The Wall Street Journal.","description":"This is In Real Terms, a weekly column analyzing the latest economic news.

Most of the first half-hour was dedicated to various scandals: Bill Clinton’s infidelities, Hillary Clinton’s emails and, of course, the now-infamous Donald Trump video that had dominated headlines for the previous 48 hours. It was nearly 9:30 p.m. before we got the first question on a real policy issue. (The debate started at 9 p.m. eastern.)\n\nThe final hour of the debate, however, featured some reasonably substantive discussions on a range of issues including taxes, gun control and foreign policy. The candidates also delved into some subjects that didn’t get much attention in the first debate, such as energy and health care. Somewhat surprisingly, however, there was once again very little discussion of immigration (apart from one exchange about Muslim immigration and terrorism). There was also significantly less discussion of trade this time than last, although Trump did manage to repeat his (dubious) claim that NAFTA was the worst trade deal “in the history of the world.”\n\nFor the full rundown of what the candidates discussed, check out our live blog. But here are a few highlights from the major policy debates of the evening.\n\nClinton: “If we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap … 20 million people now have health insurance. So, if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is, we just turn it back to the insurance companies, the way it used to be.”\n\nTrump: “Obamacare is a disaster. You know it, we all know it. … Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money. More and more money. … We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive, and something that works.”\n\nThe debate over Obamacare — much like the American health care system itself — is far too complicated to cover in a few paragraphs. But at the most basic level, here is where the U.S. health insurance system stands six years after the passage of President Obama’s signature health law: The Affordable Care Act largely succeeded in its goal of bringing health insurance to millions of Americans who didn’t previously have it (although 29 million Americans remain uninsured). But it has not yet succeeded in bringing down health care spending overall, or in ensuring that all Americans can afford to seek medical care.\n\nClinton’s approach was to acknowledge those problems and pledge to address them while simultaneously reminding voters about parts of the law that they actually like. The law prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions, for example, and allows young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents’ insurance plans. The American health care system isn’t perfect, Clinton acknowledged — at one point, she said, “If we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system” — but like most Democrats, she believes it makes more sense to fix it than to start over.\n\nTrump, by contrast, said Obamacare is beyond fixing and should be fully repealed. (On our live blog, our in-house health care expert Anna Maria Barry-Jester questioned whether that’s even possible at this point.) The Republican nominee vowed to replace the ACA with a better system but provided few details on what that might be. The one specific proposal he did make was to “get rid of the … artificial state lines where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing.” That is a reference to a longtime Republican proposal to allow companies to sell insurance across state lines, boosting competition and, in theory, lowering cost. But as Margot Sanger-Katz wrote in The New York Times last year, the real barrier to interstate insurance sales isn’t regulation but rather the difficulty of setting up hospital networks in new areas.\n\nTrump: “She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. … Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that frankly we could change. But you wouldn’t change it because all of these people gave you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. … I understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president.”\n\nClinton: “Since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald who pay zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education — that is wrong. And we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.”\n\nIt’s easy to forget now, but before Friday’s video-tape scandal, the big revelation that rocked the campaign between the debates was the publication by The New York Times of documents suggesting that Trump might have paid no federal income taxes for as long as 18 years. Somewhat surprisingly, it was Trump who first raised the issue, claiming to “pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.” Later on, however, he confirmed the substance of the Times’s reporting — that he had used a $916 million loss to avoid paying taxes — although he wouldn’t say for how many years.\n\nTrump, as he has before, said that because he knows how to use the tax code to his advantage, he would also be in the best position to fix it. And he implied that he would raise taxes on the rich, stressing his proposal to eliminate the so-called “carried-interest loophole” that allows some wealthy Americans to pay lower taxes on certain kinds of income. But independent analyses, including those from conservative groups, find that other provisions in Trump’s tax plan would more than offset the closing of that loophole, and that overall the rich would pay less under his proposed policy. (Some middle-class families, meanwhile, would probably pay more.)\n\nClinton, unsurprisingly, seized on the Times’s revelations as evidence that the tax code is rigged in favor of the rich — something she said she’d worked to fix as a senator and would help change as president. An analysis of her tax plan from the Tax Policy Center, which is jointly run by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, found that it would raise taxes by $1.1 trillion over the next decade, with essentially all of that coming from the richest 1 percent of Americans; the bottom 95 percent would see little change to their tax bills.\n\nClinton may have overstated things when she said that the gains during the recovery “have all gone to the top.” In 2015, according to the most recent data available, the biggest income gains were among those lower down the earnings spectrum.\n\nClinton: “I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy. I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests.”\n\nTrump: “I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. … I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance and that was the line. And she didn’t.”\n\nClinton is often criticized by liberals for being too hawkish on foreign policy, a criticism Trump has tried to stoke by claiming — falsely — to have himself opposed the Iraq war, which Clinton supported. (Clinton has since called her vote authorizing the war a “mistake.” There is no evidence that Trump spoke out against the war before it began.) On Sunday night, however, the difference between the candidates was less about how aggressive the U.S. should be and more about whom that aggression should be directed against.\n\nClinton ruled out using American ground forces in Syria, but she called for other forms of military action against both ISIS and the Syrian regime. In the case of ISIS, she called for the targeting of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as well as for working more closely with Kurdish and Sunni opponents of ISIS. But she also called for a no-fly zone and a safe zone in Syria to protect civilians from the Russian-backed regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and to give the U.S. “leverage” at the negotiating table. (How she would accomplish those goals without a major commitment of U.S. forces is unclear.)\n\nTrump, for his part, explicitly broke with his running mate, Mike Pence, in saying the U.S. should focus on destroying ISIS rather than targeting the Assad regime. (“He and I haven’t spoken and I disagree,” Trump said of Pence.) Trump, who has previously praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and has often been accused of being too close to Russia, didn’t outright defend Russia’s Syria policy. But he did say that Russia and Syria are both “killing ISIS” while the U.S. does little. In fact, Russia and Syria have barely skirmished with ISIS.\n\nTrump: “Energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. … The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania, and you see what they are doing to the people. Miners and others in the energy business. It’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace.”\n\nClinton: “I support moving towards more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st-century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind. … Those coal miners and their fathers and grandfathers, they dug that coal out, a lot of them lost their lives. They were injured. But they turned the lights on and they powered their factories. I don’t want to walk away from them.”\n\nTrump and Clinton agree on one thing when it comes to energy: Coal miners are in trouble and need help. No surprise there: Coal country includes the crucial battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania. But Trump and Clinton disagree about why coal miners are in trouble and what to do about it — along with essentially everything else when it comes to energy.\n\nTrump’s basic narrative on energy is simple: It’s the government’s fault. Restrictive environmental regulations are killing not just the coal industry but the oil and gas industry too. That’s partly correct when it comes to coal: Environmental regulations have hurt the industry, and Obama’s currently stalled Clean Power Plan, if enacted, would probably hurt it more. But the bigger factor has been the surge in natural-gas production, which has pushed down the price of natural gas and made coal less competitive.\n\nThe oil industry also faces challenges in much of the country — Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin recently declared an “Oilfield Prayer Day” in response to the state’s struggling energy industry — but due to low prices, not regulation. Those low prices are to a large degree the result of the U.S.’s own oil boom, combined with the decision by OPEC producers to allow low prices to try to put American producers out of business.\n\nClinton is a villain in much of coal country for her comment at a town hall meeting last March that she was “going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” Clinton has since apologized for the comment, and she has cleaned up her messaging, but her policy remains the same: Faced with climate change, the U.S. should transition away from coal as quickly as possible, but the government should try to help those who lose jobs as a result. Clinton has a $30 billion “plan for revitalizing coal communities,” which includes reforming benefits for miners suffering from “black lung,” repurposing coal mine and power plant sites, and creating new tax credits to encourage private investment in communities that have lost coal-industry jobs. But her plan has been met with skepticism by many coal communities, and by many experts.","description":"For a while during Sunday night’s presidential debate, it seemed like policy issues might never come up at all.

The shareholders’ legal motion argues that if no delay is possible, the court should reject the process entirely.\n\nSagard, which owns 17 per cent of PSG, has made a $575-million (U.S.) offer for PSG in conjunction with investment firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., which is not a PSG shareholder. Sagard, a U.S. investment firm controlled by Canada’s Desmarais family, has also teamed with Fairfax to offer PSG an emergency debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan to allow it to continue operating.Samuel Robinson, president of Sagard, said the company’s goal is to work closely with PSG’s management to increase the value of its iconic sporting goods brands, such as Bauer and Easton.“The Sagard/Fairfax bid is valued and structured to be thoughtful and fair to all stakeholders, and includes provisions and bid protections which are customary for this type of transaction,” Mr. Robinson said in a statement.The offer was unveiled at the end of October as the Exeter, N.H.-based sports-equipment manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States, and is serving as a so-called stalking horse bid that must be beaten by any other potential buyer.However, the shareholder group says the Sagard offer threatens to “freeze out” shareholders, while reserving much of the company’s value for the Sagard group. In court filings, lawyers for the ad hoc committee said the short time frame and the structure of the Sagard deal could deter others from coming forward to try to make a better offer that could create more value for PSG’s shareholders.“The proposed sale process – led by Sagard’s stalking horse bid – has all the outward appearances of an ‘inside job,’” the group said in a legal filing. “Potential bidders do not tend to expend the time and money to engage in M\u0026A processes where a board [favourite] has the ‘inside track’ to winning.”The ad hoc committee of shareholders is asking that an upcoming hearing to approve the bidding procedures and DIP financing, which is scheduled to be heard Nov. 30, be delayed “for at least a short period of time” to allow the committee to investigate and prepare its case.The court filing does not disclose which shareholders of PSG are members of the ad hoc committee, but the company has several large institutional shareholders that are not involved in the offer to purchase PSG’s assets. Investors face losing much of their investment in PSG under the terms of Sagard’s bid, which will leave little for common shareholders after debt holders are paid.The shareholder group said features “designed to chill competitive bidding” include a minimum bid requirement of $582.5-million, which must be paid all in cash, a required “good faith deposit” of 5 per cent of the purchase price in cash, and excessive “bid protections” including a $20.1-million break fee owed to Sagard and a requirement for the company to reimburse $3.5-million of Sagard’s expenses if it is not the winning bidder.The group said the practical effect would be to require any potential bidder to arrange more than $600-million in cash over the Christmas holiday season just to match the Sagard group’s bid. The shareholders also complained that PSG did not solicit any competing stalking horse offers or commission a fairness opinion of the Sagard Group’s bid.When it filed for bankruptcy protection, PSG said that it was facing a “severe liquidity crisis.” But the group of shareholders says PSG shows “little need for ‘fresh capital’” and that there’s no financial reason why the bidding process has to occur so quickly. “There is, in fact, no liquidity crisis,” their filing said. “There is only ‘deal’ crisis [self-created by the deal participants].”They are seeking to have their objection heard on Nov. 21.","description":"U.S. court receives objection from insolvent sporting good manufacturers’ shareholders over fairness of proposed asset auction","keywords":"Fairfax Financial Holdings Inc.;shareholder;bid;offer;sell-off;insolvent;sporting good manufacturer;Performance Sports Group;auction;assets;Sagard Capital Partners LP;","time":1479337147,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/proposed-performance-sports-group-sell-off-raises-ire/article32880011/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"CRTC head Blais defends his record, critiques shutdown of Shomi","body":"Jean-Pierre Blais is defending his four-year record as chairman of the federal telecom and broadcast regulator with a defiant speech that took on critics and industry players and emphasized Canadian consumers are central to everything he does. In a keynote address Wednesday, Mr. Blais, who has led the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission since 2012, said that after making efforts to include and engage the public in hearings and other work the regulator does, he hopes Canadians now “trust us at least a little more than they did four years ago.”\n\nHis speech featured notably harsh words for Shaw Communications Inc. and Rogers Communications Inc. regarding their September announcement that they plan to shut down their joint venture online-streaming service Shomi at the end of November.Mr. Blais said the move came as a shock to him and while he didn’t want to “criticize the decisions taken by seasoned business people … I can’t help but be surprised when major players throw in the towel on a platform that is the future of content – just two years after it launched.“I have to wonder if they are too used to receiving rents from subscribers every month in a protected ecosystem, rather than rolling up their sleeves in order to build a business without regulatory intervention and protection.”Shomi’s owners have said the service failed to attract enough subscribers in a rapidly changing and fragmented marketplace for online video that includes domestic competition from Bell Media’s CraveTV as well as global giant Netflix Inc.“We created a beautiful service that customers loved. The problem is not enough of them loved it to pay the bill,” said then-Rogers CEO Guy Laurence in early October.Both Shaw and Rogers have lost money on the service, with Rogers recording a loss of $140-million in the third quarter related to Shomi, and Shaw stating it expects to incur an investment loss of up to $120-million when it next reports its quarterly earnings. (That follows a writedown of $51-million on Shomi’s value the company already recorded earlier this year).In an interview after his speech, Mr. Blais said “there are a lot of failures in business,” and if every company that faced losses shut down, “you would never start a new business in Canada.”“Unfortunately, that’s the world we live in in the communications sector. It’s borderless, it is subject to a lot of international competition and losing money is part of it,” he said.Mr. Blais, whose term as chair expires next June, sought to frame his legacy during a period of incredible change for the communications industry – owing to the disruption of the Internet – as a regulator that intervenes when necessary but otherwise stays out of the way.“The CRTC’s role now is to focus on outcomes rather than making rules,” he said during his lunchtime speech in Ottawa to an annual conference of the Canadian chapter of the International Institute of Communications.Many of the CRTC’s decisions under his tenure have, in fact, involved rules and regulations – such as the commission’s move to regulate the wholesale rates that wireless carriers charge small competitors, its ruling that large Internet providers must provide resellers with access to their highest-speed fibre-optic broadband services, and the requirement that cable and satellite providers offer slimmed-down basic packages and offer a choice of individual channels on top of that.“I’ve always said regulation is a poor substitute for a properly operating marketplace,” Mr. Blais said in the interview. “I think the rules we’ve put in place have been rules that have tried to support a dynamic marketplace.”Mr. Blais’s wide-ranging speech also took aim at critics of CRTC decisions, who he said “take to TV and radio broadcasts and their own private blogs to spread fear and worry, and I dare say make false and misleading statements.”He later said he has little patience for those who fail to show up and present evidence before the commission but later complain about the results.Mr. Blais was also defiant in the face of a wave of criticism the commission faced – which he called “spilled ink and exhaled air” – over its August ruling that reduced the number of “points” necessary to win access to certain funding and tax credits for Canadian content. Groups of actors and writers have said this will undermine the Canadian creative industry.During an appearance before the federal Heritage committee on Oct. 20, Liberal MP Seamus O’Regan asked Mr. Blais why the CRTC didn’t hold off on that decision until the Minister of Canadian Heritage has completed a sweeping review of Canadian cultural policies currently under way, which even put the CRTC’s mandate up for discussion.“We got elected. We want to institute it democratically. We want to institute a comprehensive review. I would have thought that perhaps some respect would be shown to that wish,” Mr. O’Regan said.The time expired on Mr. Blais’ appearance and he did not have a chance to respond that day, but in his speech Wednesday he said calling for the CRTC to stop its work while the Minister conducts her review, “ignores that Parliament has bestowed upon us a mandate to act in the public interest.“Those who are asking us to stop are operating under the belief that the minister’s review will be favourable to them,” he said. “The disruptive nature of broadband is not taking a pause while the review is ongoing.”","description":"In a defiant keynote address, the regulator’s chairman Jean-Pierre Blais emphasized the centrality of the Canadian consumer in everything he does","keywords":"Netflix Inc.;Shaw Communications Inc.;Rogers Communications;Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission;jean-pierre blais;Media;communications;regulator;Shomi;streaming;NFLX-Q;SJR-N;SJR.B-T;","time":1479337039,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/crtc-head-blais-defends-his-record-critiques-shutdown-of-shomi/article32880060/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Canada may be finally seeing a revival of business investment","body":"Report on\n\nEconomic Insight\n\nDelving into the forces that shape our living standards for Globe Unlimited subscribers\n\nHome»\n\nReport on Business»\n\nEconomy»\n\nEconomic Insight\n\nThe recent flow of Canadian economic data has had a distinct just-okayness to it, and the September manufacturing statistics were no exception.

Ms. Dart was speaking at a panel discussion at Bloomberg LP’s Women on Boards event Tuesday in Toronto.\n\n“Just get over it. Change it. Put it out there and get it done. Thirty years of talk? How much more do we need?” Representation of women on boards rose only 1 percentage point to 12 per cent in 2016 from a year earlier, even after Canadian regulators announced a “comply-or-explain” rule in October, 2014. It required companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange to disclose the number of women in director and senior executive roles, as well as their diversity plans. The federal government proposed a similar law in September that would affect about 40 per cent of publicly listed firms.Women filled 15 per cent of 521 vacant Canadian corporate board seats this year, according to a September review published by the Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella group of provincial regulators. Almost half of the TSX-listed companies still have zero women on the board, according to a report by Osler, Hoskin \u0026 Harcourt LLP, a Toronto-based law firm.The government could lead the way in imposing quotas and giving procurement contracts to companies with good diversity policies, said Ms. Dart, who is also the steering committee chair of the Canadian chapter of the 30% Club.“By putting a quota in for crown corporations, it also signals that the government might not shy away from a quota,” Ms. Dart said. “That stick is out there and the government might use it if there is no other corrective mechanism.”A spokesperson for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Sarah Kavanagh, former commissioner at the Ontario Securities Commission, who worked on the new rules, said the results of the first year were incredibly disappointing.“I am just shocked by the results,” Ms. Kavanagh, who sits on the board of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and HudBay Minerals Inc., said. “I thought it would make a much bigger difference.”Ms. Kavanagh said she hopes Canada doesn’t have to go to targets right away. “I’m pretty sure this year you’re going to see a little movement on the disclosure and a little more emphasis on the importance of adding women.”Changing the definition of merit to include broader skills and not just executive experience will also help get more women onto corporate boards, she said.Small investors have a big role to play in improving corporate diversity because large investors perceive it to be riskier, said Fred Pinto, head of wealth and asset management at Qtrade Financial Group, including its OceanRock Investments Inc. unit. Both are part of the Desjardins Group, the largest co-operative in the country with about $261-billion in assets.Mr. Pinto led OceanRock’s unsuccessful challenge to push Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International Inc. to add women to its all-male board.“Investors are waiting for someone else to speak up on the issue,” he said.","description":"U of T business professor Beatrix Dart calls for new, enforceable targets to ensure boardroom equality","keywords":"board;quota;Canada;corporate;company;women;gender diversity;equality;companies;","time":1479332905,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/quotas-may-be-only-way-to-counter-lack-of-women-on-canadian-boards/article32878679/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Canadian satellite maker MDA turns to U.S. market to drive growth","body":"Iconic Canadian satellite technology firm MacDonald Dettwiler \u0026 Associates Ltd. had to shift its focus to the United States to ensure it keeps growing, the company’s new chief executive officer says.Howard Lance, a American who was named CEO of MDA in May, said the reorganization of the company that puts control of its operations in the United States was crucial in order to get new military contracts.\n\nAlso on The Globe and Mail\n\nUpdated November 16 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

Meanwhile, another hog producer has opened an eatery in a trendy Tokyo district to show off its pork.“The Japanese consumer is probably the most powerful consumer of pork in the world, and they understand the difference in quality,” said Claude Vielfaure, president of the hog-processing company HyLife.Rich premiums paid by Japanese consumers have fuelled intense competition and led to cross-Pacific partnerships between North American hog producer Smithfield Foods and Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp., as well as processor HyLife with trader Itochu Corp.Tyson Foods Inc. and Maple Leaf Foods Inc. also rank among North America’s biggest pork suppliers, while processors NH Foods Ltd. and Itoham Yonekyu Holdings Inc. and meat wholesaler Starzen Co. Ltd. import large volumes of North American chilled pork.U.S. exporters shipped 147,000 tonnes of chilled pork to Japan from January through August, setting a record-brisk pace, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF). Canada sold $679-million worth of pork to Japan for the period, its fastest pace in 11 years as measured by value.The shipments show trade growth is possible based on consumer tastes and favourable prices, due partly to the yen’s strength against the greenback and Canadian dollar, even as broad trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership suffer setbacks.Pork is the second-most consumed meat in Japan after fish, according to USMEF.Japanese buyers pay about $1.20 per kilogram more than domestic buyers, factoring in the exporter’s premium, freight and tariffs, said Ray Price, president of Alberta processor Sunterra Group. For a large high-quality loin, that works out to a bump of $5.40 to the wholesale price.In September, Manitoba-based HyLife opened a restaurant in a Tokyo business district to enhance its reputation, serving back ribs and pulled pork salad.HyLife, which is 49 per cent owned by Japan’s Itochu, is spending up to $125-million to expand processing and boost Asian sales.At Lucyporc’s Quebec plant, pigs rest in a quiet barn for 16 to 24 hours before slaughter to reduce stress, compared with the industry standard of two to five hours. The result is juicier, better-tasting tenderloins, general manager Denis Levasseur said.Olymel, which gives its pigs the ginger- and mint-infused feed, acknowledges the spices do not change the taste of the meat. But it gives the company a marketing edge, said Richard Davies, senior vice-president of sales and marketing.In the United States, packers Rantoul Foods and Smithfield process hogs that are specially bred for Japan, distributed by Sumitomo and sold as Silky Pork brand.Japan produces just over half of the pork it consumes, limited by farmers’ advancing age and the more than double production cost compared with North America, said Takashi Koiso, managing director of the Japan Pork Producers Association. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government aims to raise that to 58 per cent to satisfy Japan’s appetite for dishes such as fried or gingered pork.The United States and Canada, Japan’s two largest offshore chilled pork suppliers, take advantage of shorter shipping times than European competitors, who sell mainly cheaper frozen pork, said Erin Borror, an USMEF economist.Japanese trading house Itoham has doubled chilled pork imports from Canada during the past five years and plans a further boost of 20 per cent this year over last year, spokeswoman Aiko Komeda said.To be sure, Japan is not within everyone’s reach.J.H. Routh Packing Company, a family-owned Ohio processor, sticks to serving U.S. buyers, avoiding the high cost of Japan’s specifications.“We found our niche,” sales manager Tony Stearns said. “Trying to go and develop another market, [for which] we would have to buy equipment that costs millions – there’s no real value in doing that.”While premiums can be lucrative, Japanese buyers often pay less than domestic buyers in spring, when prices rise, said Dave Bulgarelli, vice-president of sales at Rantoul.“You have to make what they want, not what you want to sell,” he said.","description":"Japan’s growing appetite for pricey pork cuts is driving Canadian and U.S. fresh pork exports to record levels, spurring producers to use every advantage to gain market share","keywords":"pork;pigs;meat;Japan;Canada;exports;pork exports;Canadian pork;","time":1479331323,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/pampered-canadian-pigs-feed-japans-hunger-for-pricey-pork/article32878279/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"TSX falls as resource stocks weigh","body":"Canadian stocks fell on Wednesday after climbing the most in seven weeks, as material producers slumped with metals and banks slipped a second day on speculation gains had gone too far too quickly in the past week.The S\u0026P/TSX Composite Index lost 0.16 per cent, or 22.88 points, 14,733.22 in Toronto, halting a two-day advance.

The Dow has closed higher for seven days, with the last four at record levels.But investors were still looking for clarity on how much of Mr. Trump’s campaign promises would become a reality, while preparing for higher interest rates and inflation.His proposals to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending are seen boosting economic activity and inflation, while a dismantling of foreign trade agreements or an imposition of tariffs on imports would be expected to hurt the U.S. economy.“You’ve got a little bit of a hangover from the Trump rally today,” said Steven Chiavarone, a New York-based associate portfolio manager at Federated Investors Global Allocation Fund. “The market priced in pretty quickly a very rosy scenario but now you’re seeing a little doubt on the counter frame as he puts together his team.”The Dow Jones industrial average was unofficially down 54.92 points, or 0.29 per cent, to 18,868.14, the S\u0026P 500 had lost 3.45 points, or 0.16 per cent, to 2,176.95 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 18.96 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,294.58.While financial stocks gave back gains on Wednesday they were still well above their pre-election levels as investors are betting on higher interest rates and lighter regulation.Even with a 1.4-per-cent decline, the financial sector is still over 9 per cent higher than before the election. JPMorgan’s 2.5-per-cent fall weighed the most on that sector.The S\u0026P technology index, which is down 1 per cent since the election, rose 0.9 per cent and led the gainers on Wednesday, helped by Apple and Microsoft.U.S. technology companies, most of which manufacture their products overseas, could bear some of the biggest brunt of any new trade restrictions.Traders are pricing in an 81-per-cent chance that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Thomson Reuters data.Despite the recent pullback, technical analysts say they expect the S\u0026P 500 to hit a record high in the near future.“Short-term overbought conditions could generate consolidation in the days ahead, but we expect the SPX to ultimately follow the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000 Index to new highs,” Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note.The U.S. dollar index, a measure of the greenback’s value against a basket of currencies, hit 100.57, its highest since April 2003. It was last up 0.14 per cent at 100.37. The euro fell 0.4 per cent to $1.0683, while the yen was little changed at 109.13 per dollar, having earlier fallen to 109.75. The greenback rose to an eight-year high against the Chinese yuan of 6.8798 yuan.“The market has gone a bit too far ahead of itself. It looks vulnerable for a short-term pullback,” said Mazen Issa, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in New York, referring to the dollar rally.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.21 per cent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe  edged down 0.06 per cent.Oil prices eased in volatile trading on Wednesday as the market gave more weight to a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude inventory build than Russia’s comments about a possible meeting with Saudi Arabia that renewed hopes for a production freeze deal.Brent futures fell 32 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to settle at $46.63 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 24 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to settle at $45.57 per barrel.That followed a near 6-per-cent price surge on Tuesday on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would renew efforts to limit production ahead of its official meeting in Vienna.Russia said it was ready to support OPEC’s decision on an output freeze and sees big chances that the oil producers’ group can agree on the terms of the freeze by Nov. 30, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.Meanwhile, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude stocks increased for a third straight week and rose by a bigger-than-expected 5.3 million barrels last week, topping analysts’ 1.5 million-barrel build in a Reuters poll.“Fundamentals are weighing on oil prices following the release of the weekly oil inventory report from the U.S,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.“Price volatility will increase as we approach the OPEC meeting scheduled for Nov. 30, but markets will not ignore fundamentals,” Mr. Kumar said.With files from Bloomberg News","description":"Oil eases in volatile trade as U.S. crude build faces OPEC freeze hopes","keywords":"Donald Trump;Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;TSX Group;S\u0026P Company;Manulife Financial Corporation;Fairfax Financial Holdings Inc.;United States Federal Reserve System;technology;stock;opec;oil;market;crude;meeting;interest rates;energy ministers;oil prices;financial stocks;MFC-T;","time":1479330267,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/market-updates/us-stocks-dow-sp-500-drop-as-us-bank-rally-wanes-tech-boosts-nasdaq/article32877627/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Cattle farmers urge Canada to retaliate if U.S. reimposes labelling regime","body":"Hereford Angus Cross cattle are pictured on the Bell L ranch near Airdrie, Alberta in this September 30, 2012 file photo. (TODD KOROL/REUTERS)\n\nCattle farmers urge Canada to retaliate if U.S. reimposes labelling regime\n\nAdd to ...\n\nCanadian cattle producers will urge Ottawa to retaliate against the United States if the incoming Trump administration imposes a meat labelling program it views as discriminatory, restarting a six-year trade battle, an industry group said on Wednesday.U.S. news network CNN reported on Tuesday that a memo drafted by President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team, which it obtained, said the new administration would immediately initiate changes to the North American free-trade agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico. Those changes could include measures on country of origin labelling, CNN reported.\n\nThe U.S. country of origin labelling (COOL) program required as of 2009 that retail outlets label food according to its origin. Canada and Mexico argued that COOL, repealed in December, led to fewer of their cattle and pigs being slaughtered in the United States.“We’re watching … and if we think it discriminates against our cattle, our recommendation is going to be that tariffs go into place immediately” on U.S. products, said John Masswohl, director of government and international relations for the Canadian Cattlemen’s Association, which represents Canada’s 68,500 beef farms and feedlots.The World Trade Organization last year authorized Canada to retaliate against the United States over COOL, setting the annual level at $1.06-billion. The previous Canadian Conservative government listed in 2013 three dozen U.S. product categories that could be subject to a 100-per-cent surtax, including pork, beef, cherries, appliance parts, chocolate, wine and office furniture, but none were imposed.Alex Lawrence, spokesman for Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, would not say if Canada is inclined to retaliate, adding that Ottawa looks forward “to working very closely with the new administration and with the United States Congress, including on trade and investment.”Until it’s clear how Mr. Trump might approach COOL, no action is necessary, Mr. Masswohl said. “I don’t go around chasing ghosts. If anything starts to become real, we’ll know well in advance.”The Canadian Pork Council, which represents the country’s hog farmers, is taking a wait-and-see approach until it knows what changes, if any, the next U.S. government will make, executive director John Ross said.\n\nAlso on The Globe and Mail\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

The bidders’ names and deal value were not previously disclosed.\n\nShareholders want the company to disclose more details of the offer so they can weigh it against Kirkland’s planned acquisition of Newmarket Gold. Results of a shareholder vote on the Kirkland Lake-Newmarket deal are due Nov. 25.“Your shareholders deserve the opportunity to vote on the best offer for the company, and the board has a fiduciary duty to find it,” Kirkland Lake shareholder John Tumazos, chief executive of New Jersey-based John Tumazos Very Independent Research, wrote in a Nov. 14 letter to the miner’s board.Mr. Tumazos has voted his 215,950 Kirkland Lake shares against the Newmarket deal, he said in the letter seen by Reuters.Kirkland Lake CEO Tony Makuch said the only firm offer on the table was Kirkland’s planned takeover of Newmarket.“What was presented was a non-binding, conditional proposal based on some yet to be determined mix of cash and shares,” Mr. Makuch said in an e-mailed statement, referring to the Gold Fields-Silver Standard offer.Mr. Makuch said financial and legal advisers to Kirkland’s board had found the proposals “financially inferior” to the Newmarket deal.“In terms of ensuring that shareholders are treated well, it would be good to have a sense for the basis on which the board decided not to go down that road,” said a fund manager at one of Kirkland Lake’s 10 biggest shareholders.“As much information as possible is best in the situation,” added the manager, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.Daniel Oliver, founder and managing member of New York-based hedge fund Myrmikan Capital LLC, said he would vote his Kirkland Lake shares against the Newmarket deal, describing it as a “mad drive for growth.”Harry Dobson, Kirkland Lake’s former chairman and a current shareholder, also said last week he plans to vote against the Newmarket transaction.At least two-thirds of Kirkland Lake shareholders and more than half of Newmarket investors must back the $1-billion all-share transaction by a Nov. 23 voting deadline.To be sure, there may be adequate support for the Kirkland Lake-Newmarket deal, especially after influential advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis recommended shareholders back it.Glass Lewis, while remaining supportive of the Kirkland Lake-Newmarket transaction, said after news the other bids came out that its “ability to evaluate the alternative acquisition proposal remains somewhat limited.” The proxy firm cited the lack of details about the exchange ratio and the cash-stock split between the suitors.Kirkland Lake, which has mines and mills in Ontario, said on Monday the majority of shareholders it has talked to support the transaction with Newmarket, which has mines and projects in Australia.Joseph Foster, a portfolio manager at New York-based Van Eck, Kirkland Lake’s biggest shareholder, declined to comment. He told Reuters on Nov. 5 there was not much synergy in the Newmarket deal but it did create a niche, high-grade underground miner.Kirkland Lake chairman Eric Sprott was not available for comment. Mr. Sprott declared a conflict of interest in the Newmarket takeover as he owns around 13.45 per cent of Newmarket. He also owns 6.7 per cent of Kirkland Lake.An Oct. 28 Kirkland Lake circular states that Mr. Sprott recused himself from all Kirkland Lake board deliberations, discussions or voting on the Newmarket offer.Silver Standard declined to comment on the Kirkland shareholders wanting to open talks, while Gold Fields did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","description":"Gold Fields and Silver Standard Resources have made three joint bids for the miner and recently upped their offer to $1.4-billion","keywords":"Kirkland Lake Gold Inc.;Silver Standard Resources;shareholders;Mining;gold miner;Gold Fields;takeover bids;","time":1479329939,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/some-kirkland-lake-shareholders-urge-miner-to-engage-with-bidders/article32877865/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"BoC won’t move in lockstep with Fed rate moves, Lane says","body":"The Bank of Canada says it won’t necessarily move in lockstep with the Federal Reserve if the U.S. central bank moves to hike its key interest rate next month, as widely expected.“We are free to adjust our policy interest rate in the context of Canadian economic conditions – and in particular, do not need to move in step with the Federal Reserve,” deputy governor Timothy Lane said in a speech Wednesday in Waterloo, Ont.\n\nCanada’s economy will, nonetheless, feel the reverberations from whatever the Fed does. Mr. Lane pointed out that higher U.S. rates would likely send the Canadian dollar lower, boost exports and push up some rates here.Canada’s status as a net importer of foreign capital exposes the economy to the vagaries of global flows, Mr. Lane acknowledged.The Bank of Canada would take the Fed’s move into account, but won’t feel compelled to match it, Mr. Lane said.“The Bank of Canada would thus clearly need to take the net effects of the Fed’s move into account, alongside other factors, in making Canadian monetary policy,” he said.Canada’s central bank has kept its key rate unchanged at 0.5 per cent since two rate cuts in 2015.Investors are betting that a Fed rate hike in December is now a virtual certainty in the wake of Republican Donald Trump’s win in last week’s U.S. Presidential election. Trading in Federal Funds futures suggests a better than 90-per-cent chance of a December hike.And a top Fed official reinforced that view Wednesday, saying only a major economic shock would stop it from its first hike since December, 2015.“You would have to have a surprise at this point,” for the Fed not to increase rates, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, a voting member of the U.S. central bank’s rate-setting committee, told reporters at a UBS banking conference in London.Canada is already feeling the reverberations of higher global interest rates, which ratcheted up following Mr. Trump’s surprise win in last week’s election. Some of Canada’s major banks, including the Royal Bank of Canada, responded by raising some of their mortgage rates this week.“Over the past week, market interest rates and capital flows worldwide have shifted sharply, along with changing perceptions of the direction of the economic policies of the United States,” Mr. Lane pointed out.Investors are now betting that Mr. Trump may push through a major infrastructure spending program as well as tax cuts. That would drive U.S. economic growth and push up inflation.Fears that the United States could turn much more protectionist under Mr. Trump could also cause a flight by investors out of emerging market economies and into the relative safety of U.S. Treasury bills and other bonds.","description":"Canada’s economy will, nonetheless, feel the reverberations from whatever the Fed does","keywords":"James Bullard;United States Federal Reserve System;Royal Bank of Canada;rate;fed;economy;central bank;interest rates;rate moves;policy interest rate;key interest rate;","time":1479315784,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/market-shifts-after-trump-win-may-signal-exit-from-emerging-economies-boc-official-says/article32872825/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"TSX falls as financial and resource shares decline","body":"Canada’s main stock index fell on Wednesday as the financials and materials groups lost ground, while some losses for energy shares were pared as oil turned higher.At 11:02 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S\u0026P/TSX composite index fell 55.59 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 14,700.51.The decline follows the index’s biggest gain on Tuesday since September. It has rallied 13 per cent this year, but has been in a holding pattern since posting a 16-month high at 14,963.60 in October.\n\nFinancials pared some recent gains for a second straight day as yields on longer-dated bonds fell. Toronto-Dominion Bank fell 0.5 per cent to $62.10, while the overall financials group was down 0.4 percent.Higher bond yields improve the net interest margin for banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities.Yields had climbed since the U.S. election last week as investors bet that President-elect Donald Trump will pursue policies that will trigger higher inflation.The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.6 per cent, while industrials fell 0.4 per cent as railroad stocks lost ground.Energy shares pared some earlier losses as oil turned higher after initially giving back some of the previous day’s sharp gains.Suncor Energy Inc fell 1.6 per cent to $40.68, while the overall energy group was down 0.4 per cent.Just three of the index’s 10 main groups rose, with the consumer staples group rising 2 per cent.Grocery and pharmacy retailer Loblaw Cos Ltd reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as expenses fell and discounting attracted more shoppers.Its shares rose 3.9 per cent to $67.32.The pace of Canadian manufacturing sales slowed in September, while volumes fell, data from Statistics Canada showed, suggesting a softer transition for overall economic growth heading into the final quarter of the year.The S\u0026P and Dow were lower in late morning trading on Wednesday as financial stocks dropped after a seven-day rally since Mr. Trump’s surprise election win, while a recovery in technology shares boosted the Nasdaq.U.S. stocks have been on a tear since Trump’s victory. The Dow had closed higher for seven days, with the last four at record levels.But they have given back some gains as investors look for more clarity regarding his policies and brace for higher interest rates.Mr. Trump’s plans to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending would boost economic activity, while his proposal to impose tariffs on cheap imports would likely drive inflation higher.That prospect has given rise to expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster than anticipated, boosting the dollar index to a 14-year high.The Fed will hike rates in December barring any major shocks, policymaker James Bullard said. Traders are pricing in a 81 percent chance that the central bank will raise rates next month, according to Thomson Reuters data.“We’ve seen markets rally sharply since the election and now its time for a very reasonable reassessment of what’s going on. ’Have we gone too far too fast?’ This is a bit of a reality check,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial.“At this point, a December rate hike is baked in. It would require something pretty exceptional for the Fed not to hike.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 65.88 points, or 0.35 per cent, at 18,857.18.The S\u0026P 500 was down 5.14 points, or 0.24 per cent, at 2,175.25.The Nasdaq Composite was up 9.70 points, or 0.18 per cent, at 5,285.32.Seven of the 11 major S\u0026P 500 sectors were lower, with the financial index’s drop of 1.48 per cent leading the decliners.The sector has gained 10.9 per cent since the election on Nov. 8 - the biggest among the S\u0026P sectors and well above the S\u0026P’s 1.9-per-cent gain as well as the Dow’s 3.2-perc-ent rise.“Investors should book gains and wait for more evidence that the structural improvement in macro trends and regulations will materialize”, brokerage Baird said of the rally in bank stocks.JPMorgan’s 2.2-per-cent fall weighed the most on the sector.The S\u0026P technology index rose 0.59 per cent and led the gainers, helped by a rise in Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet.Target jumped 7.6 per cent after the retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast.Oil prices edged higher in volatile trading as the market weighed Russia’s comments about a possible meeting with Saudi Arabia on possible output cuts against a bigger-than-expected U.S. crude storage build.Brent futures were up 28 cents, or 0.6 pe rcent, at $47.23 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 32 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $46.13 per barrel.Before the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its petroleum status report, both contracts were down less than 1 percent. That followed a surge of almost 6 percent on Tuesday on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would renew efforts to limit production.EIA said crude stocks increased by a bigger-than-expected 5.3 million barrels, topping analysts’ 1.5 million-barrel build in a Reuters poll.Russia, meanwhile, said it was ready to support OPEC’s decision on an oil output freeze and sees big chances that the oil producers’ group can agree on the terms of the freeze by Nov. 30, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday.The U.S. crude build dampened Tuesday’s rally on news that OPEC members were meeting ahead of an official group gathering on Nov. 30 to build consensus for a deal to limit output.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said he will meet with OPEC secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo in Caracas on Wednesday to discuss the freeze.A number of energy ministers from OPEC countries are also likely to meet informally in Doha on Friday to try to build consensus over decisions taken by the full group in September in Algiers, an Algerian energy source said.Those informal meetings could include energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia. But Iran’s oil minister will not be attending, sending the country’s OPEC governor instead, sources said.“Key in this regard will be talks between the Saudis and Russia...We see enough cooperation between these two oil power houses to keep a significant amount of OPEC premium embedded in the market,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory Ritterbusch \u0026 Associates, said in a note.Dutch bank ABN Amro, meanwhile, lowered its oil price forecasts on Wednesday, expecting Brent and U.S. crude to average $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter.“We estimate the possibility of an actual OPEC production cut as 50-50,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.","description":"Oil edge up in volatile trade on U.S. crude build, Russian OPEC support","keywords":"Donald Trump;Loblaw Companies Ltd.;Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;TSX Group;Suncor Energy Inc.;Toronto-Dominion Bank;Toronto Stock Exchange Inc.;oil;energy;group;opec;crude;energy ministers;energy shares;crude build;resource shares;base metals miners;Market Updates;L-T;SU-T;TD-T;","time":1479314446,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/market-updates/at-midday-tsx-falls-as-financial-and-resource-shares-decline/article32872198/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"CPPIB sells stake in Antares unit to private investment fund","body":"(MARK BLINCH/REUTERS)\n\nCPPIB sells stake in Antares unit to private investment fund\n\nAdd to ...\n\nCanada Pension Plan Investment Board said it has sold a 16 per cent stake in its subsidiary, Antares Holdings, to a private investment fund managed by Northleaf Capital Partners.Antares is a provider of financing solutions for mid-sized private equity-backed transactions.“This important transaction reflects investor interest in Antares as a significant entry point into middle market private credit,” David Brackett, Co-CEO of Antares Capital said.\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

Hootsuite Media Inc. and D2L Inc., are also said to be considering IPOs in the second half, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The head of PointClickCare Corp. said the health care-software provider will to look at going public in 2017.\n\nAfter a flood of venture capital funding and increasing hype about Canada’s burgeoning tech industry in recent years, investors and industry experts had been expecting a rush of IPOs. Yet few materialized. Next year will be different for one key reason: the companies are on firmer financial footings.“The private market was overvaluing growth at all costs where the public market really wasn’t doing that,” said John Ruffolo, head OMERS Ventures, a unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System fund, which has investments in Vision Critical, Hootsuite and D2L. Companies that have stopped burning cash can now focus on sustainable growth and be ready to go public when the market conditions are ripe, he said.A spokesman for Markham, Ont.-based Real Matters declined to comment on its plans for an IPO. Vancouver-based Vision Critical and Hootsuite also declined to comment through their representatives. D2L Chief Executive Officer John Baker declined to speak about his timeline for going public. He said in a phone interview that the Canadian tech companies often tapped as possible IPOs were reaching maturity.It’s been a long and rocky road for the companies to get this far. There’s only been two Canadian technology companies to go public with an offering of more than $100-million in recent years: Shopify Inc. in May 2015 and Kinaxis Inc. in May 2014. Shares of Ottawa-based Shopify have surged by about 135 per cent to a market value of $3.6-billion in the U.S. since their IPO while Kinaxis has risen about 375 per cent to a value of $1.5-billion, whetting investor appetite for more.Some of the delay has been due to unfavorable market conditions, including volatile equity markets, Brexit and the U.S. election. There have only been two Canadian IPOs in the past 12 months larger than $100-million. In the U.S., several tech companies have been waiting in the wings during the election. Now that markets have stabilized, big-name companies such as Snap Inc., parent of Snapchat, Blue Apron Inc., and MuleSoft Inc. are expected to pursue share sales next year.Snapchat filed papers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before last week’s U.S. election, according to people familiar with the matter. The company is targeting a valuation of about $20-billion to $25-billion in a listing that could come as early as March.Getting the Canadian companies fit for public markets has perhaps been a bigger reason for the delays.Real Matters, which is expected to go public in the first quarter of 2017 according to the people familiar with its plans, has been growing through acquisitions, raising private capital and using it to buy smaller firms that can help it expand. Going public would help them to further that strategy.Vision Critical, which builds online communities for companies to interact with consumers, spun out its consulting unit so it could become a pure play technology company. It’s also had disagreements at the board level over the direction it should be taking. The company is trying to sell off a stake held by former chairman Angus Reid and some of its early investors, according to people familiar with the matter. That process is expected to be completed by early 2017, opening up the potential for an IPO or a sale of the company shortly thereafter, the people said.Social media marketing company Hootsuite and education software-maker D2L have been in the IPO pipeline for so long some began to speculate they may have missed their window. In recent years, both companies have focused on being cash-flow positive rather than demonstrating growth over profitability. In Hootsuite’s case, that meant laying off almost a 10th of its 1,000 employees.D2L built out its San Francisco office and hired new executives who’d worked at large tech companies in the past, CEO Baker said. “The company’s really humming on all cylinders right now,’’ he said. “It’s going to be a good year.’’Several late-stage private technology companies are evaluating public-market options both in Canada and the U.S., said Sanjiv Samant, group head of technology, media and telecommunications investment banking at National Bank Financial.“With the U.S. election behind us and hopefully some increased clarity on the international front, we’re becoming more optimistic about where 2017 might lead,” he said. “We are confident that there is strong latent investor interest in high-quality growth opportunities.”Mississauga, Ontario-based PointClickCare, which originally filed for a dual listing in Toronto and New York in September 2015 before the market began to stumble, is one of those companies that will look at going public in 2017, CEO Mike Wessinger said in an interview at Bloomberg’s Toronto office on Tuesday.As long as the companies can keep growing and positive market conditions persist, expect IPOs to hit the market soon, with Real Matters expected to go public first, Ruffolo said. “I think we’re going to finally start to see it,” he said. “Fingers crossed.”","description":"Real Matters Inc. and Vision Critical Communications Inc. are likely to lead the advance in the first half of 2017","keywords":"Shopify, Inc.;Snapchat, Inc.;technology;company;market;public;ipos;tech companies;market conditions;technology companies;Canadian lift-off;Canadian technology companies;telecommunications investment banking;SHOP-N;SH-T;Technology;Hootsuite;Real Matters;Vision Critical Communications;Shopify;D2L;","time":1479311482,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/tech-ipos-finally-poised-for-canadian-lift-off-after-false-starts/article32871227/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Chrysler releases first hybrid minivan, costs less than gas version in Ontario","body":"2017 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid (FCA)\n\nRoad Test\n\nReview: Chrysler releases first hybrid minivan, costs less than gas version in Ontario\n\nAdd to ...\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were lower.\n\nCrude oil prices dropped more than 1 per cent, returning some of the gains made in one of the year’s biggest rallies a day earlier.That had helped Canada’s main stock index notch its biggest gain since September on Tuesday.Wall Street opened lower on Wednesday - a day after the Dow closed higher for the seventh session in a row following Donald Trump’s election win - as investors braced for higher interest rates.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49.78 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 18,873.28.The S\u0026P 500 lost 5.42 points, or 0.25 per cent, to 2,174.97.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.18 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,254.44.Mr. Trump’s plans to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending would boost economic activity, while his proposal to impose tariffs on cheap imports would likely drive inflation higher.That prospect has given rise to expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates faster than anticipated, boosting the dollar index to a 14-year high.A higher dollar hurts the overseas income of multinational companies.“We had a pretty sharp rally off the election and it was pretty impressive, but it seems pretty clear to me that sort of emotional reaction, if you will, is now long off,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas.“At this point we kind of have to get back to the fundamentals, and we could very well be in just a sort of wait-and-see mode until we get to the Fed meeting.”The Fed will hike rates in December barring any major shocks, policymaker James Bullard said, adding that a single rate increase may be enough to move monetary policy to a “neutral setting”.Traders are pricing in a 90.6-per-cent chance that the central bank will raise rates next month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool.The S\u0026P has gained 1.9 per cent since the election on Nov. 8. The Dow has risen 3.2 per cent and closed at a record high for the past four days.However, investors are also waiting for more clarity regarding Trump’s policies and what campaign promises will materialize into policies as well as keeping an eye on key appointments to his administration.Oil prices fell on Wednesday, returning some of the gains made in one of the year’s biggest rallies a day earlier, after weekly U.S. crude stocks rose beyond expectations and a strong dollar weighed on commodities.Global benchmark Brent crude as down 34 cents at $46.61 a barrel. It closed Tuesday 5.7 per cent higher on news that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would renew efforts to limit production.U.S. crude was 45 cents lower at $45.36 a barrel.“Prices are down on the build in U.S. crude oil stocks reported by the API last night,” said Tamas Varga, oil analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates.A strong dollar also weighed on oil, with the index measured against a basket of currencies hitting a 14-year high.Weekly U.S. crude oil stocks surged by 3.6 million barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute (API) industry group said, exceeding analyst expectations of a 1.5 million barrel rise.Official U.S. government oil stocks data will be published later on Wednesday.The news dampened a rally infused by news that OPEC members were meeting ahead of an official group gathering on Nov. 30 to build consensus for a deal to limit output, and by oil pipeline attacks by militants in Nigeria.A number of energy ministers from OPEC countries are likely to meet informally in Doha on Friday to try to build consensus over decisions taken by the full group in September in Algiers, an Algerian energy source said.However, Iran’s oil minister will not be attending, sending the country’s OPEC governor instead, sources said.“We estimate the possibility of an actual OPEC production cut as 50-50,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.“If OPEC would stick to its intention to set its production ceiling at 32.5 million barrels a day, or even lower, market optimism will likely pick up, which could be supportive for oil prices.”The Dutch bank lowered its oil price forecasts on Wednesday, expecting Brent and U.S. crude to average $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter.In a bullish signal for the oil market, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday oil consumption will peak no sooner than 2040 despite the entering into force of the Paris climate deal which intends to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.","description":"Wall Street drops after post-election rally","keywords":"Donald Trump;Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;TSX Group;S\u0026P Company;United States Federal Reserve System;Toronto Stock Exchange Inc.;expectations;crude;oil stocks;crude oil;oil prices;crude oil stocks;stock index;Wall Street;","time":1479307482,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/inside-the-market/market-updates/at-the-open-tsx-falls-as-energy-and-financials-retreat/article32870879/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Are you a first time home buyer?

Statscan says Canadian factory sales rose 0.3 per cent in September. (© Mark Blinch / Reuters)\n\nCanadian factory sales slow in September, volumes fall\n\nAdd to ...\n\nThe pace of Canadian manufacturing sales slowed in September, while volumes fell, data from Statistics Canada showed on Wednesday, suggesting a softer transition for overall economic growth heading into the final quarter of the year.The 0.3 percent increase in sales topped economists’ expectations for a gain of 0.1 percent, though it was a step down from August’s hefty 0.9 percent increase.\n\nIt was also driven largely by gains in the transportation equipment sector. Although sales were up in 12 out of 21 industries, a 1.5 percent increase in the sector accounted for more than 85 percent of the total gain in manufacturing sales.The volume of goods sold in September, which strips out the effect of changes in price and is watched by economists, declined 0.2 percent.Economic growth is expected to have snapped back strongly in the third quarter as a whole following a contraction in the previous quarter but that rate is not expected to be sustained in the last three months of the year.Robert Both, macro strategist at TD Securities, said the fourth quarter was on track for annualized growth of 1.5 percent, in line with the Bank of Canada’s recently downgraded forecast.The forward-looking new manufacturing orders measure rose 2.3 percent on increases in the transportation equipment and machinery sectors. Inventories also rose 0.5 percent, with increased stocks seen in the transportation equipment, food and chemical industries.Statistics Canada revised seasonally adjusted data for sales, inventories and orders going back to January 2011, while the unadjusted figures were revised back to January 2013.\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

The vote has also whipsawed the financial markets, triggering a rally in equities and soaring bond yields on the expectation that Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress will champion programs to fuel growth.In a piece he titled “Populism Takes a Wrong Turn,” Gross said many of the policies Trump favours represent the status quo – and a Clinton administration would have been no better. “Neither party as they now stand has bold policies beyond the reach of K Street lobbyists,” he wrote.Gross questioned the need for corporate tax cuts, saying that U.S. companies are among the world’s most lightly taxed. Another popular Republican idea, the repatriation of trillions of dollars of corporate profits held overseas, probably won’t lead to more investment in America, he said.Pundits who think that Trump’s win represents a victory for middle-class America are mistaken, he said, using a fox-in-the-henhouse metaphor.“The Trumpian Fox has entered the Populist Henhouse, not so much by stealth but as a result of Middle America’s misinterpretation of what will make America great again,” he said. Trump’s “tenure will be a short four years but is likely to be a damaging one for jobless and low-wage American voters.”Gross, who said he didn’t vote for either major party candidate for President, said the U.S. would be better served by a jobs program that puts people to work helping other people. Government should be the employer of last resort, he said.The Janus Global Unconstrained Bond fund gained 4.7 per cent this year through Nov. 14, better than 67 per cent of peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said on Nov. 15 that he’s bullish on Trump and bearish on bonds.“We think that there’s a significant likelihood that we have made the 30-year top in bond prices,” Dalio wrote on his LinkedIn page. “We probably have made both the secular low in inflation and the secular low in bond yields relative to inflation.”Trump’s presidency will mark a move to the right akin to the Ronald Reagan era, he said, a period that will likely be characterized by decreasing globalization, increased U.S. growth as well as higher inflation.Jeffrey Gundlach, co-founder of DoubleLine Capital, said yesterday the stock market is in for a “bumpy ride” as expectations are dashed that Trump can quickly spur growth.","description":"Bond manager of Janus Capital said president-elect’s plan to reduce taxes and increase infrastructure spending unlikely to bolster economic growth or equities","keywords":"Donald Trump;Hillary Clinton;Janus Capital Inc.;trump;corporations;policies;American voters;bond manager;America;United States of America;Bill Gross;","time":1479301673,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/investment-ideas/bill-gross-says-trump-will-be-one-termer-in-failure-for-populism/article32870536/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Metro’s profit climbs 10 per cent","body":"A woman walks into a Metro grocery store in downtown Montreal.

Ltd., the biggest in the field, and Metro Inc., which ranks No. 3, both reported better-than-expected profit on Wednesday as expenses fell and discounting attracted more shoppers.\n\n“We are reducing the prices to see if we can draw the customer back in and we are having a reasonable degree of success,” Galen G. Weston, Loblaw’s executive chairman, told an analyst conference call. “We are pretty happy with the results so far.”Loblaw saw some inflation at the beginning of its third quarter, which turned to deflation by the end of it, resulting in zero inflation over all. Metro reported 0.7-per-cent inflation in its fiscal fourth quarter, which spanned roughly the same period as Loblaw’s quarter.After a couple of years of rising prices – $8 cauliflowers became the poster child for food inflation last year – grocers are feeling the pressure to moderate prices after consumers started to resist higher ones. Some of the biggest increases came in the meat and fruit and vegetable departments, prompting consumers to ditch cauliflowers and switch to lower-priced items.And a growing number of consumers are switching to discount from traditional, higher-priced supermarkets, or opt for the low-cost, U.S.-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Costco Wholesale Corp. Both Loblaw and Metro operate discount banners, including Loblaw’s No Frills and Real Canadian Superstore, and Metro’s Food Basics and Super C.To help it lower prices, Loblaw told its suppliers this summer to drop their wholesale prices by 1.45 per cent, starting in September. Other grocers, including Metro, followed suit.“We’re pleased with those discussions with our suppliers,” Eric La Flèche, chief executive officer at Metro, told a later analyst conference call. “For competitive reasons, I’ll leave it at that. But we’re making progress. … On our pricing, I can tell you we are competitive. We make the price investments [reductions] that are necessary to stay competitive. It’s aggressive. It’s promotional and we compete pretty well.”He said the trend of consumers heading to discount rather than conventional chains continues, but at a slower pace.Metro started to respond about a year ago to consumer resistance to higher prices by dropping its prices. Loblaw, for its part, waited several months before it began to lower prices this year.“We shifted quite definitively into a deflationary position as we exited the [third] quarter,” Mr. Weston said on Wednesday. “We think it’s meaningful. … It’s manageable deflation.”Profit at Loblaw was helped by lower selling, general and administrative costs and an increase in same-store sales at existing outlets in the quarter, the company said.Loblaw said revenue climbed 1.4 per cent to $14.14-billion in the third quarter ended Oct. 8, edging past the average analyst estimate of $14.12-billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company’s adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders rose to $512-million, or $1.26 a share, from $408-million, or 98 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.12 a share.Same-store sales at outlets open a year or more – a key retail measure – rose 1.4 per cent, compared with a 3.1-per-cent drop a year ago. At Metro, those sales picked up even more – by 2.8 per cent (compared with a 3.4-per-cent increase a year ago.)In its fourth quarter ended Sept. 24, Metro reported a 10-per-cent increase in its profit to $145.0-million, or 60 cents a diluted share, compared with $131.7-million, or 52 cents, a year ago.Sales in the quarter totalled nearly $2.93-billion, up from $2.83-billion in the same quarter last year.At Shoppers Drug Mart, which Loblaw acquired almost two years ago, Mr. Weston said the company is intent on selling marijuana prescribed for medical reasons.He said the company has applied to the government for a mail-dispensing licence to sell marijuana, following in the footsteps of other mail-order firms.And Loblaw is part of the pharmacy industry’s discussions with Ottawa and the provinces to get the green light to dispense medical marijuana from its drugstores’ pharmacy counters.“We see that as a really compelling change in approach for managing marijuana,” Mr. Weston said. “We think that the pharmacy business is extremely well suited for processing controlled substances and we think there are significant medium-term opportunities for marijuana to be part of the pain-management-therapy formula for Canadians as we move forward. So we’re keen on it.“As far as what the size of the opportunity is, let’s say it’s meaningful but it’s not transformational to the pharmacy business.”He also said Loblaw is pleased with the early results of selling beer and wine in its grocery stores in Ontario. He said selling alcoholic beverages draws more shoppers to Loblaw stores and boosts the amount that each customer purchases, although it doesn’t directly contribute to improved profit margins.“We are being very careful that we don’t overpay for the [liquor] licences that we do want to have access to,” he said. “But we will continue to add as those licences become available.”","description":"Grocers report better-than-expected numbers as less expensive food allows for discounting to attract more shoppers","keywords":"Loblaw Companies Ltd.;Retail;grocery;stores;pharmacy;shoppers drug mart;L-T;Metro Inc;food;prices;deflation","time":1479297888,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/loblaws-profit-jumps/article32870450/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Target raises profit forecast; earnings rise","body":"Target Corp on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its fiscal-year forecast after benefiting from a strong back-to-school shopping season and higher online sales.The Minneapolis-based retailer’s shares, which had been down nearly 2 per cent year to date, rose 8.1 per cent to $77.22 in morning trading.\n\nTarget’s performance has improved from recent quarters, when competition from online rivals like Amazon.com Inc and slower sales of smaller items like electronics and food hurt earnings. Target was forced to shake up its top leadership with three high-profile exits in the past four months.“Although Target’s performance has improved, it would be wrong to say that it is now a company firing on all cylinders,” said Neil Saunders, chief executive officer of research firm Conlumino. He said Target’s sales still showed the company is losing market share overall.The company said demand for Apple Inc merchandise, which was disappointing in the second quarter, improved because of new products like the iPhone 7. Ahead of the holidays, advance orders for the brand were three times higher than a year earlier.Last week, department store rivals like Macy’s Inc and Kohl’s Corp struck an optimistic note going into the holiday season and said they expected consumer spending to accelerate this quarter.Target CEO Brian Cornell said store visits increased and sales trends improved by a percentage point during the third quarter ended on Oct. 29.Digital sales jumped 26 per cent, an acceleration from previous quarters. Comparable sales in high-margin “signature” categories such as baby, health and wellness outpaced those overall by three percentage points.“As we move into the biggest quarter of the year, we are pleased with our inventory position,” Cornell said.Target forecast fiscal-year earnings of $5.10 to $5.30 per share, excluding special items, up from a prior outlook of $4.80 to $5.20. It also raised the forecast for its sales performance at stores open at least a year by one percentage point to a range of down 1 per cent to up 1 per cent for this quarter.Net income attributable to Target rose nearly 11 per cent to $608-million in the third quarter from a year earlier.Earnings of $1.04 per share before special items beat the analysts’ average estimate of 83 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total sales fell 6.7 per cent to $16.4-billion. Same-store sales dipped 0.2 per cent, while analysts on average had expected a decline 1.1 per cent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.","description":"Third-quarter earnings for Minneapolis-based retailer rose to $608-million from $549-million a year earlier","keywords":"Target Corporation;Retail;Target;earnings;TGT-N;","time":1479297320,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/us-business/target-profit-rises-nearly-11-per-cent-shares-climb/article32870440/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"British jobless rate hits 11 year-low, but warning signs appear","body":"Britain’s unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to its lowest level in 11 years in the first three months after the Brexit vote, official data showed on Wednesday, but there were signs that a slowdown in the labour market could be coming.The jobless rate edged down to 4.8 per cent in the July-September period, compared with a median forecast of 4.9 per cent in a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nBut the increase of 49,000 in the number of people in work was the slowest since the three months to March, and the number of people claiming unemployment benefit gathered speed in October, the Office for National Statistics said.Britain’s economy weathered the initial shock of the Brexit vote better than the Bank of England and almost all private-sector economists expected.However, many firms are expected to act cautiously as they wait for more clarity on what Britain leaving the European Union means for them. The BoE expects the jobless rate to stand at 5.6 per cent in two years’ time.“There are now clear signs of softness in the labor market following the vote to leave the EU,” Daniel Vernazza, an economist with Italian bank UniCredit, said, adding he expected a “slow burn” of gradually rising unemployment.The number of people claiming unemployment benefits in October rose by 9,800, the biggest rise since May, the ONS said. Changes to the benefit system meant September’s claimant count increase was revised up to 5,600 from a previous reading of 700.“The moderate upward trend in the claimant count now is clear, suggesting that the main unemployment rate will begin to drift up soon,” Samuel Tombs, an economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said.For people in work, wage growth is holding up. Total earnings including bonuses rose by 2.3 per cent, unchanged from their pace in the three months to August, though below a Reuters poll forecast of 2.4 per cent.Excluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.4 per cent year-on-year, the fastest rate in a year and in line with expectations.A survey of employers published on Monday by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development showed employers expected to make basic pay settlements of just 1.1 per cent in 2017, squeezing living standards as inflation is expected to rise to around 3 per cent after the recent fall in sterling.Britain’s trade unions said pay growth adjusted for inflation was already the slowest since early 2015. They urged finance minister Philip Hammond to give the economy a boost by investing in rail, roads, new homes and clean energy when he announces his first budget plans next Wednesday.“And he must give a direct boost to pay by lifting the public sector pay cap and increasing the minimum wage,” Frances O’Grady, the head of the Trades Union Congress, said.Separately, the ONS said productivity growth slowed in the third quarter. Output per hour rose by 0.2 per cent, slowing from growth of 0.6 per cent in the second quarter and the weakest quarterly improvement since late 2015.","description":"The unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 per cent in the July-September period","keywords":"Office for National Statistics;European Union;Bank of England;unemployment;unemployment rate;benefit claims;jobless rate;United Kingdom;economy;employment;jobs;","time":1479294625,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/economy/uk-jobless-rate-falls-to-11-year-low-benefit-claims-rise/article32870391/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"Microsoft offers EU concessions over its $26-billion LinkedIn bid","body":"The logo of Microsoft is pictured in Issy-les-Moulineaux, France, Aug. 8, 2016. The company has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26-billion bid for social network LinkedIn (© Jacky Naegelen / Reuters)\n\nMicrosoft offers EU concessions over its $26-billion LinkedIn bid\n\nAdd to ...\n\nMicrosoft has offered concessions to EU antitrust regulators over its $26-billion bid for social network LinkedIn, the European Commission said on Wednesday, as the U.S. software company seeks to allay concerns over its largest ever deal.The move came after the EU competition enforcer expressed concerns about the deal at a meeting with Microsoft executives last week.\n\nThe Commission, which will rule on the deal by Dec. 6, did not provide details. It is expected to seek feedback from rivals and customers before deciding whether to accept the concessions, demand more or open a full investigation.Microsoft declined to comment. The LinkedIn acquisition will allow it to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing.LinkedIn makes most of its $3-billion annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.U.S. rival Salesforce, which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn, has warned of the threat to innovation and competition and urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before clearing the deal.Microsoft however sees competition from social network Facebook and wants regulators to take that into account, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nUpdated November 16 4:01 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.\n\nIn the know\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nArctic haven for belugas becomes Canada’s newest protected area\n\nGlobe Investor\n\nLife\n\nFive reasons to never do crunches again\n\nLife\n\nStudies show little benefit in dietary supplements\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nWhy you should stop checking your e-mail at work\n\nThe Globe Recommends\n\nMost popular videos »\n\nNews\n\nWho is Melania Trump?\n\nNews\n\nBernie Sanders 'deeply humiliated,' wants \"profound change\" in Democratic Party\n\nNews\n\nBill Murray crashes the White House briefing room, takes questions from reporters\n\nNews\n\nWhy Donald Trump is inheriting vast powers when it comes to national security\n\nLife\n\nVideo: Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain offers his best dinner party tips\n\nLife\n\nTake sauerkraut and sausage to the next level\n\nReport on Business\n\nNews\n\nCows rescued after being stranded in New Zealand quake\n\nArts\n\nEddie Redmayne: J.K.

U.S. crude rose 32 cents, or 0.7 per cent, to $46.13 per barrel.\n\nBefore the U.S. Energy Information Administration released its petroleum status report, both contracts were down less than 1 per cent. That followed a surge of almost 6 per cent on Tuesday on news the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would renew efforts to limit production.EIA said crude stocks increased by a bigger-than-expected 5.3 million barrels, topping analysts’ 1.5 million-barrel build in a Reuters poll.Russia, meanwhile, said it was ready to support OPEC’s decision on an oil output freeze and sees big chances that the oil producers’ group can agree on the terms of the freeze by Nov. 30, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday.The U.S. crude build dampened Tuesday’s rally on news that OPEC members were meeting ahead of an official group gathering on Nov. 30 to build consensus for a deal to limit output.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said he will meet with OPEC secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo in Caracas on Wednesday to discuss the freeze.A number of energy ministers from OPEC countries are also likely to meet informally in Doha on Friday to try to build consensus over decisions taken by the full group in September in Algiers, an Algerian energy source said.Those informal meetings could include energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia. But Iran’s oil minister will not be attending, sending the country’s OPEC governor instead, sources said.“Key in this regard will be talks between the Saudis and Russia...We see enough cooperation between these two oil power houses to keep a significant amount of OPEC premium embedded in the market,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory Ritterbusch \u0026 Associates, said in a note.Dutch bank ABN Amro, meanwhile, lowered its oil price forecasts on Wednesday, expecting Brent and U.S. crude to average $50 a barrel in the fourth quarter.“We estimate the possibility of an actual OPEC production cut as 50-50,” said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro.","description":"Russia ready to support OPEC decision on output freeze; EIA says crude stocks increased by a bigger-than-expected 5.3 million barrels","keywords":"Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries;American Petroleum Institute;oil;oil prices;crude stocks;Brent;Algiers;United States of America;Doha;Nigeria;Energy;Brent crude;WTI;crude futures;","time":1479293738,"url":"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/oil-declines-after-opec-inspired-rally-as-us-inventories-rise/article32870369/?cmpid=rss1"},{"title":"In Trump’s Washington, rival powers and whispers in the president’s ear","body":"The transformation of power in Washington begins at President-elect Donald Trump’s ear. There are the intimates: Stephen K. Bannon, the controversial provocateur and keeper of Trump’s populist, nationalist flame; Jared Kushner, the unquestionably loyal son-in-law who whispers his machinations; and Jeff Sessions, the firebrand senator from Alabama whose clout is all-encompassing and often unseen. There are the operators: ­Reince Priebus, the consummate party man who will manage the White House; Paul D. Ryan, the wonky House speaker who stands ready to implement a wholesale overhaul of the tax code, health care and regulations; and Mitch McConnell, the wily Senate majority leader who intends to personally tilt the Supreme Court and federal judiciary to the right. And then there is Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is positioned to exert sweeping authority on all matters foreign and domestic as Trump’s partner in governing. These seven men, as well as Trump’s adult children and a few others, will make up an unusual power grid in a capital city used to a hierarchical structure. Trump is presiding over concentric spheres of influence, designed to give him direct access to a constellation of counselors and opinions. Such an approach also risks bringing confrontation or even paralysis as feuding factions work to further their own goals, edge out adversaries or distract Trump — as happened more than once during his presidential campaign. As president, his associates said, Trump will seek rather than shun competing advice. His presidency will be governance as a series of ongoing conversations. “He’s got this habit where he calls people every day to check in,” said Barry Bennett, a former Trump campaign adviser. “He likes a lot of input, multiple, competing voices at the table. So a top-down White House is not him.” So it is that in assembling his White House, Trump announced that his chief of staff, Priebus, and chief strategist and senior counselor, Bannon, would be “equal partners” — a departure from President Obama’s West Wing, where Chief of Staff Denis McDonough stands alone atop the pyramid. The turbulent first week of Trump’s transition has revealed a tendency in the president-elect — one that was evident throughout his business career and during his campaign — to reject rigid chains of command. So far, Trump has prized loyalty above all else. He demoted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as transition chairman in favor of Pence. People linked to Christie have been purged from the transition team — including former Michigan congressman and House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers — and acolytes of Sessions were elevated. Word has gone out to those interested in serving in the Trump administration that the top positions will almost certainly go to those who supported him during the campaign. Jason Miller, communications director for the Trump transition, dismissed discussions of the emerging power matrix as “inside baseball, palace intrigue.” “If you know anything about Donald Trump’s leadership style, it’s that he’s the one who’s going to set the tone and the pace and the vision for what he wants to accomplish with the government that he’s forming,” Miller said. “You can talk about all the different people coming on board to help implement that, but there’s one person who’s ultimately going to be driving it, and that’s the next president of the United States.” People involved in the transition said Kushner is orchestrating nearly everything alongside Trump and Pence, from personnel to the administration’s initial policy agenda. As quiet and discreet as his father-in-law is loud and combative, Kushner is said to have taken part in the ouster of Christie and the New Jersey governor’s network. It is unclear whether Kushner will have a formal role in the administration or whether he and wife Ivanka will remain in New York, where they run their own businesses and are raising three small children. Regardless, though, Kushner is certain to be a regular sounding board for the new president. “Jared Kushner’s role is to provide advice and counsel as requested by the president-elect, which he does very well,” Miller said. On Capitol Hill, leaders are calculating how to take maximum advantage of what they see as a rare opportunity with Republicans controlling both the legislative and executive branches. They believe Trump will put an emphasis on velocity — hoping for a blizzard of accomplishments early on — but focus less on the granular details, which could allow lawmakers to inject their pet priorities into Trump’s big-ticket items. It is a careful dance. While Ryan (Wis.) and McConnell (Ky.) are busily preparing a spate of bills to take up in concert with the White House, they are treading cautiously, wary of getting ahead of the president-elect and cognizant that he is driven more by relationships and instincts than a political ideology. To that end, Ryan is promoting his “A Better Way” agenda as a guide for Trump on taxes, health care and regulatory issues. “We’re ready to roll in the House with a set of policies that we think Mr. Trump will buy into,” said Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R-Wis.). “I know he’ll want to put his fingerprints on it, but it’s almost a plug-and-play scenario.” Ryan or aides speak daily with Trump’s team, with Jonathan Burks, the speaker’s longtime policy adviser, serving as a liaison. Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), an early Trump supporter, has also been a bridge between the House leadership and the Trump operation. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) said he and fellow Trump allies in the House would ensure the president-elect’s populist views, as well as his hard-line approach to illegal immigration, are infused in every piece of legislation the body passes. “For those of us who were with Trump when he had less than a 1 percent chance of winning, we want him to know that we’re here for him to rely on,” Barletta said. “We know he won’t settle for things being done slowly.” McConnell, meanwhile, is poised to be the ultimate dealmaker, considering how narrow the Republican majority is in the Senate, and already eyeing scores of vacancies in the federal judiciary, chief among them the Supreme Court seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) said he and McConnell are working along with other Senate Republicans to get Trump prepared to make a round of judicial nominations. “He’s working with us, and I suspect we’ll do just fine,” Hatch said. “He has said he’d accept someone from the Federalist Society list, and we’ll be weighing in as he makes his decisions. We know he’ll listen, because he knows this issue is one of the reasons why he won the presidency.” Trump’s ability to work with Senate Democrats remains a variable, although he and new Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer — both brash New Yorkers; Trump is from Queens and Schumer from Brooklyn — could find bipartisan bonhomie on economic issues such as infrastructure spending. “To do big, huge stuff you have to have bipartisan support,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.). “We have a 52-seat majority in the Senate, a thin margin for majority votes. When it comes to huge things, you’ll need 60. His instincts probably get that already, but if you want to move on your issues, that’s the reality.” Throughout his life, Trump has followed a pattern, said Tony Schwartz, co-author of Trump’s 1987 memoir, “The Art of the Deal.” “Trump sees himself as the straw that stirs the drink,” Schwartz said. “He has almost no interest in the details of how things happen, but he has an intense interest in being the decision-maker.” As Trump assembles his White House, he is reimagining the traditional staffing chart in the mold of his personality, with a group of aides and outside confidants expected to have direct lines to the Oval Office, members of his transition team said. Former GOP presidential rival Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon and a vice chairman of Trump’s transition committee, said the incoming team would work in harmony to transform the government. “Bannon and Priebus worked very well together during the campaign, so there’s certainly no reason to think that they won’t work well together here as well,” Carson said. “Usually things are dictated by ideology and relationships. With Trump, they will be dictated by common sense, by what’s practical and what actually works.” But other Republicans offered warning signs about erecting rival power centers. Patrick J. Buchanan, a veteran of the Nixon and Reagan White Houses, pointed out that Bannon and Priebus, regardless of their shared allegiance to the president-elect, carry with them different ideologies and experiences. “Bannon is coming in with very strong views and ideas, and those are not the same ideas that Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan and the others have — on security of the border, on trade deals, on globalization, on war and peace,” Buchanan said. “This is the reality. You’re going to have a clash in the White House — and the president is going to have to make the call.” Schwartz, who was a critic of Trump’s candidacy and informally advised Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s campaign on her opponent’s psychology, said Trump seeks a variety of opinions in part out of necessity. “He doesn’t have a clear set of guiding principles inside him,” Schwartz said. “He doesn’t have values that he feels compelled to live by. He doesn’t have a significant store of knowledge about the subjects he’s dealing with. So it would make sense that he’s casting around for intelligence, even if he doesn’t end up trusting or relying on it.” As with all things Trump, there are always people in his ear. His orbit extends to friends who may not join the government but whom he considers peers: investors Carl Icahn, Andrew Beal and Tom Barrack, and casino magnates Phil Ruffin and Steve Wynn. Amid this week’s hubbub about filling the Cabinet, Icahn took it upon himself to break some news. “Spoke to @realDonaldTrump,” he tweeted Tuesday. “Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce.”","description":"Trump to govern by seeking counsel from concentric spheres of influence in Washington.","keywords":"","time":1479340891,"url":"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t\u0026fd=R\u0026ct2=us\u0026usg=AFQjCNEY7uB6TCNpQ_KlYaG_VFWC2hJ0rw\u0026clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331\u0026cid=52779271295556\u0026ei=1lktWKChKcKnqQLnjKjwBw\u0026url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-trumps-washington-rival-powers-and-whispers-in-the-presidents-ear/2016/11/16/50f3306c-ac03-11e6-a31b-4b6397e625d0_story.html"},{"title":"Trump's First Planned Meeting With A Foreign Leader Is A Complete Mess","body":"WASHINGTON - One day before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s first meeting with a foreign leader, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japanese officials said they had not finalized when or where in New York it would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers.\n\nUncertainty over the talks shows the difficulties in turning Trump from a freewheeling businessman into a sitting president with a watertight schedule and a fully functioning administration by his inauguration on Jan. 20.\n\nJapanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined.\n\n“There has been a lot of confusion,” said one Japanese official.\n\nThe meeting was only agreed to last week and Trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in Manhattan’s Trump Tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration.\n\nWhile world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning. Abe is on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru.\n\nState Department spokesman John Kirby said that to his knowledge, Trump’s transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders.\n\nTrump is expected to use the Abe meeting to reassure Japan and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric, advisers to Trump said.\n\nBut Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, and Abe, a veteran lawmaker, have differences on policy issues such as free trade.\n\nSeveral Trump aides did not immediately answer requests on Wednesday for comment about the Abe visit or contact between the transition team and the State Department.\n\nSpeculation about top appointments to the Trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was removed last week.\n\nTrump on Wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team, singling out the New York Times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him.\n\nTrump took to Twitter to list several world leaders he had spoken with since his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican real estate magnate said he had received and taken “calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.”\n\nThe Times, a frequent target of Trump’s Twitter blasts, said on Tuesday that U.S. allies were “scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump” and blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach him.\n\nThe newspaper said Trump was working without official State Department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders.\n\n“The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,” Trump tweeted, without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect. “It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.”\n\nTrump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence had spoken to 29 foreign leaders, the transition team said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a U.S. president-elect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory.\n\nBut some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure.\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, an army general who seized power three years ago, appears to have been the first leader to speak to Trump after the election, ahead of closer allies like the leaders of Britain and Germany.\n\nSisi’s office called Trump last Wednesday and the incoming U.S. president told him it was “the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election.”\n\nAustralian media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was the second leader Trump spoke to, after the Australian ambassador to the United States got Trump’s personal phone number from Australian golfer and Trump friend Greg Norman.\n\nTrump also talked on the phone to the leaders of Britain, Germany, Turkey and other allies.\n\nBut a phone call on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two men agreed to aim for “constructive cooperation,” raised eyebrows among Democrats and traditionalist Republicans worried about a resurgent Moscow.\n\nTrump also met Britain’s anti-EU Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage at Trump Tower last weekend, ahead of any meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nState Department spokesman Kirby said: “There’s been no outreach to date” from Trump’s transition aides. “But it’s not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the president-elect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders.”\n\nDespite fevered speculation, Trump has yet to say who will fill Cabinet positions such as secretary of state, treasury secretary or defense secretary. His team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of Democrat Barack Obama to the White House after he won the presidency in 2008.\n\nSouth Carolina Governor Nikki Haley emerged on Wednesday as a potential candidate for secretary of state. South Carolina Lieutenant Governor Henry McMaster told a local newspaper he was being considered for attorney general.\n\nAfter speculation emerged that JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon remained a contender for treasury secretary, the bank’s stock price dropped.\n\nFlorida Governor Rick Scott, who has been rumored to be under consideration for secretary of health and human services, will meet with Trump on Thursday, the governor’s office said.\n\nOn the ground floor of the State Department, more than a dozen empty conference rooms await Trump’s transition team. State Department officials said Trump’s team had not yet contacted the department’s counselor, Kristie Kenney, who is overseeing the transition there.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the Trump team also had not contacted the Pentagon about the transition, officials said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu, Susan Heavey, Idrees Ali, David Alexander and Lesley Wroughton in Washington and Emily Stephenson in New York; Writing by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Bill Trott and Peter Cooney)","description":"Officials said they had not finalized when or where the meeting would take place, who would be invited, or in some cases whom to call for answers.","keywords":"Donald Trump, election 2016, prime minister shinzo abe","time":1479339840,"url":"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t\u0026fd=R\u0026ct2=us\u0026usg=AFQjCNHenZ1zOpQD36zkNovaCeiu2YKTjg\u0026clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331\u0026cid=52779269748277\u0026ei=1lktWKChKcKnqQLnjKjwBw\u0026url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-meeting-foreign-leader_us_582cecace4b030997bbd71fb"},{"title":"Senate Democrats settle on leadership team, Sanders elevated","body":"Senate Democrats settle on leadership team, Sanders elevated\n\nSen. Patty Murray was named assistant leader, avoiding a fight for the No. 2 job.\n\nFacing a party in turmoil, with moderates and progressives battling to sway its direction after a devastating election, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer decided to try to make everyone happy.\n\nThe newly elected top Senate Democrat navigated a potentially messy fight between two party leaders on Wednesday and expanded his team to include disparate voices, from the liberal Bernie Sanders to the moderate Joe Manchin. It's not a move without risk for the New York senator.\n\nHis leadership team now numbers 10 senators, a potentially unwieldy group that encompasses more than a fifth of a 48-member caucus poised to be a leading spear of opposition to President-elect Donald Trump. Schumer's moves to diversify the leadership ranks comes on the heels of Trump's success among blue-collar voters and as liberals try to keep pushing the party to the left.\n\n“We’ll unite our caucus and speak to the blue-collar worker in West Virginia and Michigan as well as the people who live along the coasts,\" Schumer said after a remarkably quick leadership meeting, which featured no contested races. “We can unite the disparate factions of our party and country. Our whole leadership team is emblematic of that. Our team is ideologically and geographically diverse.\"\n\nSchumer headed off a showdown between Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) for the No. 2 whip job, which Durbin will keep. Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) typically invited Durbin, Murray and Schumer to crucial decision-making meetings, but those \"Big Four\" sessions apparently won't continue under Schumer.\n\nUnder the new structure, Durbin will remain whip while bequeathing his title of assistant Democratic leader to Murray, who Durbin said is now No. 3 in leadership. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) will head the party's messaging arm as chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, the No. 4 job.\n\nSenate Democrats are the last line of defense against Trump's agenda because of the chamber's supermajority hurdle. They're expected to oppose any attempt to repeal Obamacare and slash tax rates, among other policies. At the same time, they want to work with him to pass a massive infrastructure package and crack down on Chinese currency manipulation.\n\nOn top of that, Democrats must defend 25 Senate seats in 2018, including five in deeply conservative states and another five in traditional battlegrounds that Trump won.\n\n“We are certainly the firewall,\" Stabenow said.\n\n“We’re unified in our desire to make it clear how potentially disastrous this administration could be to the country,\" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). \"And we’re unified in communicating a message to working-class voters that we’ll fight for them.\"\n\nSchumer has not yet landed someone to lead the party's campaign arm at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Sen.-elect Chris Van Hollen of Maryland has emerged as a leading choice. The opening was left unfilled even as the rest of the leadership team was formed.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) have joined the lower rungs of the caucus' brass, as has Manchin (D-W.Va.). They join Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mark Warner of Virginia in a caucus structure so large that rank-and-file Democrats struggled to explain the arrangement.\n\n“I can’t remember past that. Truthfully I can’t,\" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), after naming the top four Democratic leaders.\n\n“There are new members. And I’m not sure I get them straight,\" added Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).\n\nSchumer cast the burgeoning team as more in tune with Americans disgusted with the status quo after voters rejected Hillary Clinton and declined to give Democrats the Senate majority. Indeed, the elevation of Sanders adds the party's most high-profile disrupter to the leadership ranks. He'll join Warren, who was part of Reid's leadership circle.\n\nSanders, however, will continue to identify as an independent, an unusual situation for a Democratic leader to be in, to say the least. He ran for president as a Democrat but has long called himself an independent in the Senate, one who caucused with Democrats.\n\nStill, the centrist-minded Schumer is taking a \"big tent\" view of his party, rather than catering to the party's emboldened left, which supported Sanders over Clinton. In some ways, he must: Senators like Manchin will be facing an electorate in red states that overwhelmingly supported Trump.\n\nManchin, who met privately and at length with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) earlier this week, described his mission in the new post as finding ways to work with the GOP and Trump.\n\n“My job is going to be to reach across the aisle,” Manchin told reporters. “If we disagree, we’ll have a disagreement. Hopefully I can reach out and find if there’s a pathway forward.”\n\nAll 10 Democratic leaders will now attend leadership meetings, a vintage form of triangulation for Schumer, who will face skepticism from liberals for his ties to Wall Street and his deal-cutting inclinations. He said he will not replay the tactics of McConnell, who as minority leader designed an opposition strategy that constantly frustrated Reid.\n\n“We’re ready to stand shoulder to shoulder with Republicans, working with soon-to-be President Trump on issues where we agree. But we will go toe-to-toe against the president-elect whenever our values or the progress we made is under assault,\" Schumer said.\n\nThe dynamic between Murray and Durbin will be especially important given the internal jockeying for power. Murray had refused to rule out a challenge to Durbin for well over a year, preserving her leverage until the last moment.\n\n“It’s an odd thing. I had two titles,\" Durbin said. \"Patty is going to be No. 3 with the title of assistant leader. And we’re going to work together as we have.\"\n\nThe party is also undergoing some churn at the committee level with the retirement of Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) as the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) will move over to replace her, while Feinstein will assume Leahy's spot as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, which oversees Supreme Court nominations.\n\nWarner will step into Feinstein's current role atop the Senate Intelligence Committee. And with Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) retiring as the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.) will step into that role. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) will replace Carper as the top Democrat on the Homeland Security panel.","description":"Sen.

At a Children's Defense Fund event in Washington, she spoke about the importance of fighting for America's kids, but she also wove in another message, telling her supporters to persist, even after the devastating loss of the presidential race. \"I know many of you are deeply disappointed about the results of the election,\" she said. \"I am, too, more than I can ever express.\" Though her speech centered on fighting child poverty, she was straightforward in addressing her bruising defeat. \"There have been a few times this past week when all I wanted to do was just to curl up with a good book or our dogs, and never leave the house again,\" she said. Disappointment surfaced a few times in her remarks. After citing a quote she (mistakenly, as it turns out) attributed to Martin Luther King, Jr., — \"The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice\" — she quipped, \"Sometimes it can feel awfully long. Believe me, I know.\"\n\nPolitics\n\nAfter 4 Decades Of Breaking Molds, Clinton Failed To Shatter The Ultimate Ceiling\n\nPolitics\n\nRural Voters Played A Big Part In Helping Trump Defeat Clinton\n\nClinton also obliquely criticized President-elect Donald Trump. She said that she recently spoke to a Nevada girl who cried because she was afraid her parents would be deported. During his campaign, Trump promised to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally. \"No child should have to live with fear like that,\" Clinton said. \"No child should have to be afraid to go to school because they are Latino or African American or Muslim or because they have a disability.\" She addressed the despair that many of her supporters feel: \"I know this isn't easy,\" she said. \"I know that over the past week a lot of people have asked themselves whether America is the country we thought it was.\" \"But as I said last week: our campaign was never about one person or even one election,\" Clinton said. \"It was about the country we love and about building an America that is hopeful, inclusive, and bighearted.\" Clinton's ties to the Children's Defense Fund are decades old. She went to work for the fund after graduating from Yale Law School, and she has spoken about knocking on doors to find out why children weren't in school, as well as interviewing teenagers jailed alongside adults. She later became a board member and then board chair of the Children's Defense Fund. The event honored Clinton for her work for children over her lifetime, and it also honored five high school seniors receiving scholarships from the fund. In her speech, Clinton echoed her campaign trail messages: she referred to her Methodist faith, spoke admiringly of her mother, and touched on child care and paid leave, two of her key election issues. Clinton finished her speech by providing what could have been a counterpoint to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. \"I am as sure of this as anything I have ever known: America is still the greatest country in the world,\" she told the crowd. \"This is still the place where anyone can beat the odds. It's up to each and every one of us to keep working to make America better and stronger and fairer.\"","description":"She acknowledged wanting to \"never leave the house again\" and subtly criticized Donald Trump in a Wednesday night speech.

Trump said on Wednesday that his transition was not in disarray, assailing news media reports about firings and infighting and insisting in an early-morning Twitter burst that everything was going “so smoothly.”But the process of picking cabinet members continued to be volatile, as people who were described as leading contenders earlier in the week were said to be less likely to be nominated now. And the failure to take the basic organizational steps to begin the formal transition blocked the official handoff of critical information from 100 federal agencies.Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, had been a leading candidate to be secretary of state. But people familiar with the latest discussions and one person who has spoken directly with Mr. Trump said the president-elect had growing reservations about Mr. Giuliani, who for 48 hours eagerly stoked news of his possible appointment.Disclosures from Mr. Trump’s office in Trump Tower in Manhattan continued throughout the day. Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio host and author, could join the Trump administration, according to two people who have spoken to the transition team. Ms. Ingraham, a fiery critic of the news media who worked on domestic policy for the Reagan White House, has told Trump aides that she would be interested in a number of posts.\n\nLate Wednesday, reports surfaced that Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, who backed Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in the Republican primaries, might now be a candidate for secretary of state.\n\nIn a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump kicked off a concerted effort to reshape the narrative of a chaotic transition that has taken hold in the week since he won the election. In several conversations with reporters, Mr. Trump’s aides said that their efforts to assemble a new government were not in turmoil.The president-elect criticized, and misrepresented, a report in The New York Times that said Mr. Trump had taken calls from several world leaders, but had done so haphazardly and without the normal State Department briefings that traditionally guide conversations with foreign leaders.\n\nGraphic: Donald Trump Is Picking His Cabinet. Here’s a Shortlist.\n\nMr. Trump wrote that he had received “calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said.” Of the transition effort, Mr. Trump added in another post, “It is going so smoothly.”In the transition’s first conference call with reporters on Wednesday night, aides to Mr. Trump said teams would be announced on Thursday to begin the formal handoff from the State, Justice and Defense Departments and the National Security Council.Sean Spicer, an adviser to Mr. Trump, said that the president-elect would also meet on Thursday with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Ms. Haley and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, among others as he builds his administration.Advisers to Mr. Trump said that reports of chaos were being spread by disgruntled former members of the transition or people bitter about the election results. Representative Devin Nunes of California, who is a member of the executive committee advising Mr. Trump and is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the transition was actually operating more efficiently because it was not filled with Washington elitists.“The only people who are in chaos are the press,” Mr. Nunes said.Aides to Mr. Trump acknowledged that members of the transition team had been fired since the ouster of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the head of the transition. But they denied that the firings were the result of a purge of Mr. Christie’s allies orchestrated by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law. “Completely inaccurate,” said Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump.Instead, they said that the housecleaning was part of a renewed effort by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, the new transition chief, to eliminate lobbyists from the transition team. They declined to provide details about how many lobbyists had been fired or to name them, but said it was a priority.\n\n“When we talk about draining the swamp, this is one of the first steps,” Mr. Miller said.Mr. Trump has been ensconced in Trump Tower for days as he deliberates. A steady stream of potential nominees and transition officials arrived for meetings on Wednesday as the team released a list of 29 foreign leaders he and Mr. Pence had spoken with in recent days.The lobby of Mr. Trump’s transition headquarters a block from the White House in Washington appeared to be bustling, with national security, transportation and other policy advisers arriving for meetings.\n\nGraphic: 20 Things Donald Trump Said He Wanted to Get Rid of as President\n\nBut progress has been slow toward transferring control of the federal work force of 2.8 million people. A White House official said that administration officials at government agencies remained legally barred from delivering the guidance and briefings to Mr. Trump’s transition team because essential documents had still not been completed.The wholesale shake-up of Mr. Trump’s team, including Mr. Christie’s ouster, forced Mr. Pence to sign new documents required by law. White House officials said Mr. Pence delivered them on Tuesday.But by Wednesday night, Mr. Trump’s team still had not delivered a series of required supporting documents, including certifications that each transition member would abide by a code of conduct and would not divulge sensitive information about the inner workings of the government.\n\n“The next step is for the president-elect’s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government,” said Brandi Hoffine, a spokeswoman for the White House. “Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts.”The lack of progress fit with Mr. Trump’s image during his presidential campaign as a professed disrupter of the status quo in Washington, disdainful of the institutions of government and reluctant to submit to the protocols and traditions that fuel so much of what happens here.Mr. Trump was not the first president-elect to preside over a disorderly transition. George Bush’s transition in 1988 was marked by Republican infighting after many of Ronald Reagan’s aides were denied jobs in the new administration. Bill Clinton’s 1992 transition was marred by a personnel shake-up and a difficult-to-accomplish campaign promise he had made to slash the White House staff by a quarter. George W. Bush had a late start because of the disputed 2000 election result, and Barack Obama had to replace his head of personnel several times. But veterans of Washington’s transition rituals said Mr. Trump seemed to be further behind.Officials in Mr. Obama’s administration said on Wednesday that they were ready to engage with Mr. Trump’s team. But they said little contact had been made. At the State Department, officials said that no one from the transition office had requested briefings ahead of Mr. Trump’s meeting on Thursday with Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan.\n\n“We stand ready to support him and his team with any information that they might require,” said John Kirby, the State Department spokesman.\n\n“There has been no outreach to date,” Mr. Kirby added.","description":"The president-elect used Twitter to assure Americans that the handover of power was going well, despite accounts of infighting on his team.","keywords":"Presidential Election of 2016,Appointments and Executive Changes,Trump  Donald J","time":1479348091,"url":"http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t\u0026fd=R\u0026ct2=us\u0026usg=AFQjCNFthgZyzE9hUB7vKEupqUBnedgNIQ\u0026clid=c3a7d30bb8a4878e06b80cf16b898331\u0026cid=52779273644170\u0026ei=1lktWKChKcKnqQLnjKjwBw\u0026url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/us/politics/donald-trump-administration-twitter.html"},{"title":"Suspect indicted in New York, New Jersey bombings","body":"Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

As Whitehead told Fresh Air's Terry Gross earlier this year, his idea was born first of a childhood misunderstanding: that the Underground Railroad was, in fact, a literal locomotive. He nurtured that idea into his adulthood, turning it into an exploration of the United States. The novel traces a slave's journey to freedom as a kind of American Gulliver's Travels, \"rebooting every time the person goes through a different state,\" Whitehead told Gross. Perhaps the most emotional moment of the night came just a bit earlier, though, when the medal for young people's literature went to March: Book Three. The third book in a series of graphic memoirs, the collaboration by Rep. John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell tells the story of Lewis' work during the civil rights movement. As Lewis accepted the award with Aydin and Powell, he tearfully recalled his childhood in rural Alabama, where he says the library refused to give him a library card because of the color of his skin. But he did not relent. \"I had a wonderful teacher in elementary school who told me, 'Read my child, read!' \" Lewis said. \"And I tried to read everything.\"\n\nHe added: \"To come here and receive this award — it's too much.\"\n\nThe nonfiction prize went to scholar Ibram X. Kendi's Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas in America. Kendi's comprehensive study finds the threads of racism as they wind throughout U.S. history and traces them from their origins. Even as he delved deeply into some of this country's bleakest moments, Kendi said in his acceptance speech, he kept his belief in that country and its people. \"I just want to let everyone know that I spent years looking at the absolute worst of America,\" Kendi said. \"I never lost faith that the terror of racism would one day end; in the midst of the human ugliness of racism, there is the human beauty of the resistance to racism.\" Daniel Borzutzky took home the prize for poetry, for his book The Performance of Becoming Human. A bleak, often dystopian book, it is a work that came out of \"the idea that literature and poetry can serve as a means of producing a social and historical memory,\" Borzutzky said. One medal, however, came as no surprise: Robert A. Caro had already been announced the winner of the medal for distinguished contribution to American letters, the National Book Foundation's version of a lifetime achievement award. The journalist and biographer, who is perhaps best known for his multivolume biography of Lyndon Johnson, has won more literary awards than would be feasible to list here — including another National Book Award, in 2003 for The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate. In accepting his medal, Caro made the award less about his own work than those who have supported him over the decades.\n\nAuthor Interviews\n\nIn 'Passage,' Caro Mines LBJ's Changing Political Roles\n\n\"The most important thing about a journey is your companions,\" he said, and one companion especially: his wife, Ina. Other historians may have a team of researchers at their disposal, he said, and \"I have a team of researchers, too: It's Ina. She is the whole team.\" Yet even amid the glitz and the winners, one figure in particular seemed to cast a long shadow over the evening — and he wasn't even in attendance. Donald Trump, both explicitly and implicitly, served as a focal point of many of the night's speeches. Host Larry Wilmore set the tone early, taking aim at the president-elect with a series of quips and barbs in his opening monologue. Of Trump's election last week, Wilmore noted: \"It's exciting in the way that an asteroid hurtling toward Earth is exciting.\" Later, he added the that the election was having its own effect on bookstores across the country: \"They're moving all copies of the Constitution to the fiction section.\" Others, however, responded to the events of the past week in more somber tones. Poets Toi Derricotte and Cornelius Eady — who accepted the literarian award for service to the literary community on behalf of their organization Cave Canem — spoke of the role that poets have in shaping the narrative around minority communities.\n\nBook News \u0026 Features\n\nOne Way To Bridge The Political Divide: Read The Book That's Not For You\n\n\"Right now, as we speak, there are people in a building trying to write a narrative about who we are. When you allow that narrative to be taken from you, bad things happen,\" Eady told the crowd. The nonprofit Cave Canem, the 12th recipient of the literarian award, has spent 20 years dedicated to supporting and promoting the work of African-American poets nationwide. And, in a declaration to close out his speech, Eady explained the group's work — and the work of so many of the authors present — this way: \"Our job and duty is we get to say who we are — to write our story, who we are, in our own language in our own way.\" On a night that so often swung between laughter and resolve, his colleague Derricotte's closing statement felt especially fitting: \"Joy is an act of resistance.\"","description":"Six writers emerged with the literary prize: Whitehead in fiction; Ibram X.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the Indian citizens late Tuesday, and said 500 and 1000 rupee notes would cease to be legal tender at midnight.\n\nTo minimise possible difficulties to citizens, transactions using old 500 and 1000 rupee notes were accepted at government hospitals, railway ticket bookings, government buses, and airports. The notes were also accepted at public-sector petrol-pumps, government-authorised consumer co-operative stores, milk booths authorised by State governments, and cremation grounds till Friday midnight. These shops were obliged to have a record of their stocks and sales.\n\nOld Five hundred and 1000 rupee notes could can be exchanged in banks, head and sub post offices from November 10 till December 30\n\nIn his announcement, Modi said, \"For your immediate needs, you can go to any bank, head post office or sub post office, show your identity proof like Aadhar card, voter's card, ration card, passport, income tax PAN card number or other approved proofs and exchange your old 500 or thousand rupee notes for new notes.\"\n\nModi also announced those who failed to change their currency till December 30 can exchange the notes at Reserve Bank of India (RBI)'s office along with a declaration form till March 31. The notes can be exchanged till December 30 at any branch of any bank across India.\n\nBy Saturday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said demonetised money equivalent to almost US$30 billion was deposited in banks across India. According to estimate, the old notes accounted for 85% of the total money in circulation. New 500 rupee and 2000 rupee notes are to be issued. Modi said RBI would exercise caution from past experience and limit the circulation of large-value notes.\n\nInternational tourists could purchase up to 5000 rupees using the old notes at airport exchanges till Friday.\n\nA limit was imposed on cash withdrawal; a maximum of 10000 rupees each day, and 20000 rupees each week, can be withdrawn. Moreover, from Thursday (November 10) till November 24, 4000 rupees can be exchanged in the banks and post offices. The amount is credited to the bank account.\n\nGovernment workers were informed about demonetising when the announcement was made. Modi announced all banks would remain closed for public work on Wednesday.\n\nIn the United States, Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election on Tuesday, immediately after which stock markets dropped globally. Following the US election and demonetising the money, the Indian stock market fell by 1700 points on Wednesday. Sensex lost 1,688.69 points and Nifty lost 111.55 points on the same day. Indian technology sector companies experienced loss. TCS suffered 4.93% loss and Infosys lost 2.74%.\n\nThe Indian rupee is also used in the neighbouring countries of Bhutan and Nepal. The border area uses Indian currency for day-to-day transactions. The Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan (RMA) has announced the exchange of old notes will be facilitated till December 15. RMA governor Dasho Penjore informed Indian news site The Wire, \"We do not know exactly how much Indian currency of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 is in circulation in Bhutan. We will get a better idea after the deadline to deposit their amount\". RMA has 30% of its international exchange reserve in Indian rupees. Nepal Rastra Bank directed all Nepali banks to stop conducting transactions using the Indian rupee.\n\nOn Thursday, there were long queues in front of ATMs and banks to exchange the old notes and withdraw money. BBC reported some banks ran out of cash. Police were called to some banks to maintain discipline.

Some emphasised cash-less transaction as well. BBC reported some traders and small business owners in Delhi threatened to call a strike as this move affected their business.\n\neRetail websites like Amazon and Flipkart announced they would not accept the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes on Cash on Delivery orders. Amazon also announced 15% discount on gift cards worth 500 or 1000 rupees.\n\nThe government ceased all transactions using the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes before Saturday. But a Wikinews correspondent noticed a jeweler shop accepting the demonetised notes on Saturday. When questioned, the jeweler said they were accepting the old notes only on purchase. When the correspondent, who did not identify as a reporter to the shop owners, said the old 500 and 1000 rupee notes were not legal money, they said they will exchange the notes in a bank since there were 50 days to exchange with a new and legal tender. They refused to exchange old 500 rupee notes with change, asserting the customer needs to buy merchandise from their shop.\n\nCrowded scene in front of State Bank of India\n\nState Bank of India remained open at night, and a long queue of people waited outside the ATM to withdraw money\n\nCAnara Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nKarnataka Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nCorporation Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nAxis Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nSyndicate Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nKarnataka Bank's ATM remained closed on Wednesday\n\nThis article features first-hand journalism by Wikinews members.

Republicans also kept control of both houses of Congress. Trump is to take the presidential oath in January.\n\nTrump won at least 290 electoral votes, while Clinton won 228, according to AP (Associated Press) — 270 were required vote to win the election — though Clinton won more national popular votes, 47.7% compared to Trump's 47.4%. Trump won the crucial electoral votes of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. The electors of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had not supported a Republican presidential nominee for more than a quarter century, but in this election between them they provided Trump 30 electoral votes.\n\nAccording to law, the citizens vote for an elector in the state who promises to vote for a particular candidate. In most states, the candidate who wins most votes in a state wins all electors of the state. Different states have varying numbers of electors, which depend on the state's population. Since there are 538 electors in the US, one needs to win an absolute majority of the electors, that is, at least 270. Due to the electoral college, a candidate can win the presidential election even if he/she receives lesser national popular vote.\n\nIn her concession speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton said, \"We owe him [Donald Trump] an open mind and a chance to lead.\" Clinton also said, \"We've spent a year and a half, bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that We believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone, for people of all races and religions, for men and women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities; for everyone.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama had called Trump \"uniquely unqualified\" during the election campaign, but, after the president-elect victory of Trump, Obama met him in the White House yesterday and said, \"My number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.\" After the meeting, Trump tweeted, \"A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O [Michelle Obama] a lot!\"\n\nFollowing the unexpected result of the election, people protested in various US cities, often chanting \"Not my president\". On Wednesday, more than 60 people were arrested in New York, and a crowd blocked the entrance of Chicago's Trump Tower. Lily Morton, a 17-year-old student protester, said yesterday, \"This generation deserves better than Donald Trump [...] The queer people, colored people, women, girls, everyone that is going to be affected by this, we need to protest to help them. There is still love in this country.\"\n\nDuring the voting, huge traffic on the Canadian immigration website resulted in a site crash, officials said. Justin Trudeau tweeted, \"I’ve just spoken with President-elect Trump – and we agreed to meet soon to keep building the Canada-US relationship.\"\n\nLast year, after the Paris attack in November, Trump commented on Muslims saying, \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\" He also said, \"our country can not be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.\" But after winning the president-elect, the statement on Trump's website was removed, and it redirected to the donation page.\n\nTrump partisans defended Trump saying those proposed actions were to insure safety rather than targeting any religion. Though the statement disappeared from the web site, various defences of it are still there.\n\nMexican president Enrique Peña Nieto congratulated Donald Trump and tweeted, \"I congratulate the US on its electoral process and reiterate to @realDonaldTrump [Donald Trump] our willingness to work together for our bilateral relationship.\". Mexican currency, the peso, dropped 13% in value as Trump won. Trump had proposed to abandon the trilateral US–Mexico–Canada NAFTA agreement (North American Free Trade Agreement) and to build a wall at the US–Mexico border. Mexican Foreign Minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu said Mexico would not pay for this wall.\n\nPreviously in 2016, Mexico reinforced the peso three times by increasing its benchmark interest rate.\n\n70-year-old Donald Trump will be the oldest US president to first enter the office. No woman has ever been the US president.","description":"","keywords":"","time":1478891625,"url":"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_elected_US_president"},{"title":"Ronaldo signs extended contract with Real Madrid to 2021","body":"Jump to: ,\n\nReal Madrid\n\n8 November 2016: Ronaldo signs extended contract with Real Madrid to 2021\n\n1 November 2016: Bale signs contract extension with Real Madrid to 2022\n\n15 October 2016: Toni Kroos signs Real Madrid contract extension\n\n30 May 2016: ¡La Undécima!: Real Madrid wins 2015-16 UEFA Champions League 5-3 on penalties\n\n7 May 2016: Real Madrid edge Manchester City to reach fourteenth European Cup Final\n\nPillars of Wikinews writing\n\nWriting an article\n\nYesterday, Spanish capital football club Real Madrid announced winger and Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a new five-year contract running through June 2021.\n\nFile photo of Cristiano Ronaldo, 2015.\n\nRonaldo joined Los Blancos in the summer of 2009 from English club Manchester United F.C.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\n\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: the Free \u0026 Equal Foundation holds a presidential debate with three little-known candidates; three additional candidates give their final pleas to voters; and past Wikinews interviewees provide their electoral predictions ahead of the November 8 election.\n\nContents\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nAs October started, Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton led Republican Party presidential nominee Donald Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head average 47.4% to 44.7%. In the four way race, Clinton led Trump 43.7% to 41.1% with Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson at 7.0% and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein at 2.3%. The politics of polling became a campaign issue as national polls fluctuated throughout the month with some showing as high as a 12 point lead for Clinton and others with Trump in the lead. In statewide polling, in a rarity for independent presidential candidates, Evan McMullin, who named political consultant Mindy Finn of Texas as his running mate in October, took the lead in his home-state of Utah in an Emerson poll. As Election Day, November 8, drew near, early voting began in multiple states in October. RealClearPolitics declared Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Iowa as toss-up states.\n\nTim Kaine and Mike Pence embrace before the vice presidential debate with moderator Elaine Quijano looking on.\n\nOctober was a month of surprises. As Trump continued to refuse to release his tax returns, on the first of the month, The New York Times published Trump's 1995 returns sent to them from an anonymous source. The returns showed Trump had declared a US$916 million loss in 1995, allowing him to shield $50 million in taxable income per year for the next 18 years for the purposes of federal income tax. Clinton speculated Trump did not paid any federal income taxes during the period. She asked, \"What kind of genius loses $1 billion in a single year?\" In a statement, the Trump campaign claimed The Times illegally obtained the record and accused it of being \"an extension of the Clinton Campaign.\" Going further, the statement said Trump had a \"fiduciary responsibility [...] to pay no more tax than legally required.\" Trump later argued he had \"brilliantly\" taken advantage of tax laws. A day after the publication, political operative Roger Stone warned of another WikiLeaks release of documents related to Clinton. As observers awaited the release, Trump running mate Mike Pence and Clinton running mate Tim Kaine participated in the vice presidential debate. According to AP analysis, Kaine spoke in an aggressive manner and often interrupted Pence, who remained relatively calm throughout. A CNN poll of debate watchers declared Pence the winner, 48% to 42%. Days later, still without any WikiLeaks release, Trump supporters began to wonder if any release was pending or whether an outside entity influenced WikiLeaks director Julian Assange not to release the documents. A statement from the United States Intelligence Community claimed, with confidence, that documents released on WikiLeaks were the result of hacks by the Russian government. On October 7, as Trump took some time off from campaigning to prepare for the October 9 debate, the WikiLeaks release did occur, but a different leak had a greater impact. The Washington Post set off a political firestorm as it released leaked video of Trump from 2005 speaking with Billy Bush, then a presenter for Access Hollywood, about how Trump kisses women without waiting and \"grab[s] them by the pussy,\" explaining he can get away with it because he is famous. In response, the Trump campaign immediately put out a release calling the comments \"locker room banter,\" claiming former President Bill Clinton said \"far worse\" while playing golf with Trump, and apologizing \"if anyone was offended.\" Hillary Clinton sent out a tweet calling the comments \"horrific\" and argued the American people \"cannot allow his man to be president.\" Many Republicans, including some supporters, denounced Trump. Pence was \"beside himself\" according to the Associated Press. House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump from a joint campaign appearance. Two dozen Republican officeholders including Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, John McCain of Arizona, and Rob Portman of Ohio, unendorsed Trump. Some prominent Republicans called on Trump to withdraw from the race. At the end of the tumultuous day, Trump released a taped message, again apologizing for his \"foolish\" 2005 comments while arguing \"there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people.\" He accused Bill Clinton of having \"actually abused women\" and Hillary Clinton of \"bull[ying], attack[ing], sham[ing], and intimidat[ing]\" these same women. Trump promised further discussion on the topic and affirmed his participation in the upcoming debate. The next day, he told The Wall Street Journal he would never quit the race. Pence told donors he would remain on the ticket as well. According to a Morning Consult poll, only 12% of Republicans felt Trump should withdraw. Media coverage of the tape overshadowed the WikiLeaks release of hacked e-mails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which included transcripts of paid speeches Clinton gave. Controversial parts included Clinton admitting to having both a private and public position on issues and describing her \"dream\" of a \"hemispheric common market [in North America], with open trade and open borders.\"\n\nKen Bone during the October 9 presidential debate.\n\nJust prior to the October 9 debate, Trump held a press conference with Kathy Shelton, a rape victim whose alleged rapist was defended by Hillary Clinton, as well as Paula Jones, Juanita Broaddrick, and Kathleen Willey, who have each accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety. At the event, alluding to the 2005 tape, Broaddrick commented, \"Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me.\" The Clinton campaign referred to the press conference as a \"stunt.\" As the candidates took the stage for the debate, they forewent the customary handshake. During the debate, organized as a town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper and Martha Raddatz, Trump proclaimed he had not done any of the things he mentioned in the leaked tape. Clinton attempted to connect Trump to Russia and claimed Trump lived in an \"alternative reality.\" Trump referred to Clinton as \"the devil\" and said she has \"tremendous hate in her heart.\" He called for a renewed criminal investigation into her handling of classified information. After Clinton remarked, \"it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country\", Trump quipped, \"Because you'd be in jail.\" Clinton addressed the content of her paid speeches, arguing her statement about having both private and public positions referred to Abraham Lincoln. Trump responded, \"she’s blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln [...] Honest Abe never lied [...] That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.\" Trump openly disagreed with his running mate Pence, arguing the US military should not target the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Near the end of the debate, audience member Ken Bone asked a question about energy policy. Bone's attire and demeanor turned him into an instant online viral sensation. For the final question, an audience member asked each candidate to say something nice about the other. Clinton praised Trump for his family, while Trump praised Clinton as a \"fighter.\" The two shook hands at the conclusion. Although opinion polls scored the debate as a victory for Clinton, according to Politics1.com, Clinton was \"not as sharp\" and Trump had a \"much better night\" likely enough to end the repeated calls from GOP officials for him to leave the race. A 22-member focus group hosted by Fox News pollster Frank Luntz scored the debate for Trump, 16 to 6, leading Luntz to conclude, \"Tonight was so significant that [Trump] is back in the race.\" Pence also declared Trump the winner and tweeted congratulations. The tweet served as an affirmation Pence would remain on the ticket. As Trump returned to the campaign trail, he renewed attacks against the GOP establishment, including Speaker Ryan, for its tepid support. He accused the establishment of involvement in a \"sinister deal\" to hurt his campaign. Politico reported the RNC had spent no money on TV advertisements for Trump. Nevertheless, as the media focus shifted away from the leaked 2005 tape, several officeholders who had just un-endorsed Trump, re-endorsed his candidacy. Moreover, his support among GOP members increased from 74% before the debate to 89% afterwards. WikiLeaks continued an incremental release of Podesta e-mails while simultaneously, women came forward accusing Trump of sexual misconduct. The New York Times published a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriate touching. Trump threatened to sue the paper. He accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, a Times shareholder, of being behind the story to hurt his campaign due to Trump's proposals related to Mexico. Additional women came forward accusing Trump of unwelcome kissing, groping, and sexual advances. Trump denied all the claims, at times insinuated his accusers were too unattractive for him to assault, and vowed to sue each accuser after the election. He referred to his accusers as pawns of globalist special interests and political elites, and claimed \"This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!\" As Trump and his supporters continued to describe the election as rigged, President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Trump \"seems to be in middle of the game making excuses for why he might be losing\". On October 16, the campaign took a violent turn as a GOP office in North Carolina was firebombed. Trump claimed the story would have received more attention if it was a Democratic Party office. As WikiLeaks continued to release Podesta e-mails, the nation of Ecuador shut off Julian Assange's internet access at his residence in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The nation claimed it did this to avoid interference with the US presidential election. WikiLeaks vowed to continue releasing documents. According to a new WikiLeaks e-mail dump, DNC interim chair Donna Brazile forwarded at least one question for a CNN town hall to the Clinton campaign ahead of the event during the primary campaign. Brazile denied sending the message. Conservative group Project Veritas joined in surprise releases, publishing undercover video allegedly of a Democratic Party operative discussing the use of individuals to disrupt Trump rallies and claiming the Clinton campaign was aware of the efforts.\n\nSetup of the October 19 debate with Trump, moderator Chris Wallace, and Clinton.\n\nAs the October 19 debate approached, Trump questioned the fairness of the election process, the legitimacy of opinion polls, and asked supporters to \"forget the press, read the internet.\" To the final debate, he invited President Obama's half-brother Malik Obama, who had endorsed Trump, as well as Patricia Smith, mother of diplomat Sean Smith who died in the 2012 Benghazi attack. She had previously spoken at the Republican National Convention. Clinton invited businesswoman Meg Whitman, billionaire Mark Cuban, and former basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, all of whom had endorsed Clinton. The third and final debate took place in Las Vegas and was moderated by Fox News host Chris Wallace. As in the second debate, there was no handshake between the candidates before. Unlike the second, there was no handshake afterward. During the debate, Trump stated he would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court and that the likely result would be the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Clinton countered she would nominate justices to uphold Roe. Trump received criticism for referring to illegal immigrants as \"bad hombres.\" After Trump spoke about having a closer relationship with Russia, Clinton implied Trump was a \"puppet\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin to which Trump repeatedly interrupted, \"No. You're the puppet!\" Trump referred to the Clinton Foundation as a \"criminal enterprise\" and accused Clinton of encouraging violence at his rallies based on the Project Veritas video. His most controversial comments came when he refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and near the close of the debate when he interrupted Clinton to refer to her as \"such a nasty woman.\" The \"nasty woman\" comment became a rallying call for Clinton supporters with Senator Elizabeth Warren later commenting, \"We nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get [Trump] out of our lives forever\". According to CNN's poll, Clinton won the debate 52% to 39%. However, according to CNN's 15 member focus group, Trump won 10 to 5. Frank Luntz's focus group likewise showed Trump winning, by a margin of 14 to 12. A day after the debate, Trump held a rally and announced \"I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election — if I win.\" He and Clinton both attended the traditional Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner with Archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan seated between them. Although the event was meant to feature lighthearted and often self-deprecating statements from the candidates, Trump received boos when the crowd felt he was too harsh on Clinton. Nevertheless, Clinton and Trump shook hands at the conclusion. Back on the campaign trail, Trump began using the phrase \"Drain the Swamp\" to describe the defeat of the establishment in Washington, D.C. In an October 22 speech in Gettysburg, he laid out a plan for the first 100 days of his administration and unveiled a \"Contract for the American Voter,\" which included such policy proposals as a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress, a federal employee hiring freeze, and a ban on fundraising by foreign lobbyists in US elections. He received his first major newspaper endorsement from the Las Vegas Review-Journal, owned by billionaire Trump supporter Sheldon Adelson. For the Clinton campaign, surrogates such as First Lady Michelle Obama, President Obama, and Bernie Sanders traveled about to spread the campaign's message; entertainers such as Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez also played a role. As most opinion polls continued to show Clinton ahead of Trump, Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway admitted the campaign was behind and that Clinton \"has tremendous advantages.\" Meanwhile, Trump began arguing Democrats were creating \"phony polls\" to suppress the turnout of his supporters. He also argued the media was ignoring polls such as those from Rasmussen Reports and the Los Angeles Times, which regularly showed him tied or slightly ahead of Clinton. Still, he acknowledged, \"I guess I’m somewhat behind in the polls, but not by much.\" As October drew to a close, three additional surprises threatened to change the course of the election. First, Obamacare rates were announced to be rising significantly for 2017 throughout the nation; over 50% in some states and by an average of 25% nationally. One in five users would have only one plan from which to choose. Second, more revelations from WikiLeaks including a release showing how an adviser used President Bill Clinton's status, what he referred to as \"Bill Clinton, Inc.,\" to secure donations to the Clinton Foundation from certain corporations as well as speaking fees, traveling expenses, and vacations in exchange for access, leading to accusations of pay-to-play. Third, FBI director James Comey wrote a letter to certain Congressional committee chairs stating the FBI discovered new evidence and was re-opening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. According to reports, the relevant e-mails were discovered on a device of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, who was under investigation for sexting with an under-aged girl. Weiner allegedly shared the device with his wife Huma Abedin, a top aide to Clinton. The Clinton campaign demanded to see the evidence. Senator Harry Reid argued Comey's letter may have violated the Hatch Act and accused the FBI of not releasing information about connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Commenting on the matter, Trump said, \"Clinton’s corruption on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\" Clinton said, \"No matter what they throw at us these last few days, we're not going to back down.\" In the RealClearPolitics average for October 31, Clinton led Trump 48.0% to 44.9% in the head-to-head matchup, but her lead dwindled in the four-way race, 45.6% to 42.7% with Johnson at 4.7% and Stein at 2.1%.\n\nOn October 25, the Free \u0026 Equal Elections Foundation held a debate on the campus of the University of Colorado in Boulder, moderated by actor Ed Asner and Free \u0026 Equal founder Christina Tobin. This was the organization's third election cycle hosting a presidential debate. Constitution Party presidential nominee Darrell Castle, Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva, and Reform Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente all took part in the near two-hour event. Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Evan McMullin were each invited but did not attend.\n\n\"Shame on Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in particular for not coming\", said Castle, reflecting the overall feeling of the three debaters. La Riva described the absences as \"a lack of respect for those of us who have fought so hard in this electoral year to have a voice for the people.\"\n\nSet-up of the debate stage.\n\nAlthough major party candidates have never participated in the event and are barred from doing so by the Commission on Presidential Debates, the absence of Johnson was controversial. Reportedly, Stein and McMullin did not attend because of Johnson's absence. Johnson, who participated in the same debate in 2012 along with Stein, was said by Tobin to be concerned about appearing credible to the media.\n\n\"They are so high and mighty. They want to be Democrats and Republicans so badly,\" proclaimed Castle about Johnson and Stein, \"They are afraid to come out and get down on the same level with people like us.\"\n\nThe Libertarian and Green Party presidential nominees also skipped the first Free \u0026 Equal Debate in 2008. Then-Libertarian Party presidential nominee Bob Barr missed the debate because of a previously scheduled event. Then-Green Party presidential nominee Cynthia McKinney was absent because Free \u0026 Equal did not consult with her before scheduling the event. That year, independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader and Constitution Party presidential nominee Chuck Baldwin were the only participants.\n\nCastle, who served as Baldwin's 2008 running mate, previously participated in a Free \u0026 Equal vice presidential debate that year, a fact he brought up in his opening statement. Notably, throughout the debate, Castle repeatedly expressed astonishment when he agreed with his \"socialist friend\" La Riva. However, on the first topic, there was disagreement regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline. While Castle, who said he would generally support such a pipeline, argued Dakota Access did not cross the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, La Riva rebutted the proposed route crosses lands the US government took from the Sioux. Moreover, she said the proposed route crosses the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers opening the possibility for contamination. Later in the debate, La Riva and Castle differed substantially on health care. While Castle called for a capitalistic solution, La Riva countered that capitalism was the reason for the health care crisis.\n\nDebaters, from left: Rocky De La Fuente, Gloria La Riva, and Darrell Castle.\n\nLa Riva, who was her party's presidential nominee in 2008 and was a stand-in in some states in 2012 due to the constitutional ineligibility of the party's official nominee Peta Lindsay, did not previously qualify for the Free \u0026 Equal debate. In 2012, Free \u0026 Equal extended invitations only to those candidates who reached 1% in any \"neutral\" national poll. In addition to Johnson and Stein, this included then-Constitution Party presidential nominee Virgil Goode and then-Justice Party presidential nominee Rocky Anderson. This year, Free \u0026 Equal lowered its inclusion standard to those with ballot access to at least 15% of the electorate. La Riva met this standard. In the debate, she passionately argued in favor of socialism, endorsing an \"economic, social, and political revolution,\" which entails sharing \"all the wealth that the people create\" and \"changing the economic system of capitalism to a socialist one; to a people's democracy.\" De La Fuente said he agreed with La Riva in terms of health care, arguing for fixes to Obamacare and ultimately the implementation of socialized medicine.\n\nDe La Fuente, whom Wikinews interviewed earlier this year, previously ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. During the debate, he touted himself as the \"first Hispanic-American to be on the ballot in 20 states.\" In focusing on minority issues, he discussed the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for marijuana offenses. Asner, who often commented during the course of the debate, wondered whether the discrepancy was the result of economic rather than racial factors. De La Fuente argued it might be contributed to by both.\n\nModerators Christina Tobin and Ed Asner.\n\nOn other issues, the candidates had spirited discussion. While addressing the treatment of whistleblowers such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, and Chelsea Manning, Castle referred to each as a hero and said he would offer a pardon as president. La Riva called for the elimination of the NSA, FBI, and CIA, characterizing these organizations as enemies of the American people. On the issue of military adventurism, all candidates agreed the U.S. should remove its forces from the Middle East. After Asner brought up President Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address, warning of the military–industrial complex, Castle discussed how President John F. Kennedy heeded the warning and came up with policies of his own, which he felt ultimately led to Kennedy's undoing. However, Castle was quick to say he does not subscribe to conspiracy theories. Each candidate expressed opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and NAFTA, though De La Fuente and Castle each acknowledged the necessity of free trade. On the issue of campaign finance reform, Castle proposed giving $50 million to each of the candidates on the basis of ballot access. De La Fuente said he had not considered Castle's proposal, but \"it makes a lot of sense.\" He mentioned his Democratic Party run and accused the party of \"building walls\" to prevent outsiders like himself from gaining traction. He also claimed the party cheated Senator Bernie Sanders out of the nomination. Near the end of the debate, a student from the University of Colorado asked a question about student debt. La Riva called for free education and in absence of that, proposed a student strike to demand debt-free education. Castle said the debt crisis was the result of government interference into education, saying loans would not be made if government did not guaranty them. He proposed use of bankruptcy law to alleviate the debt. De La Fuente proposed a \"virtual reality university\" using experts from around the world to teach subjects online to Americans for free, arguing Americans, and particularly minorities, lack the time to attend a four-year university.\n\nUnlike Asner, Tobin did not comment much as moderator, but she chimed in on the issue of ballot access. Tobin explained how she received an inquiry regarding ballot access for former Senator Jim Webb, who ran as a Democrat and was considering an independent run for president in 2016. She discovered it would take 900,000 signatures to achieve full ballot access, requiring the collection of 1.6 million signatures with lower range costs of US$7 to US$10 million and high estimates of up to US$20 million. In response, each candidate discussed their experiences with ballot access restrictions. La Riva proposed parties be able to qualify for nationwide ballot access.\n\nSome lighthearted moments included Asner forgetting Castle's first name, De La Fuente questioning whether an interjection from Asner would count against his time, and Castle upon reaching the end of his time, commenting on the \"relentless pressure of this woman [presumably the timekeeper] on the front row [to] stop me.\"\n\nIn closing, De La Fuente called his two fellow debaters \"presidential\" and said he \"would be proud for them to be my president, and not those two, dumb and dumber, [the major party candidates] who are trying to go for the job.\" Asner expressed appreciation to each participant, and declared the candidates \"gave this election dignity.\"\n\nBallot Access per debater\n\nCastle\n\nDe La Fuente\n\nLa Riva\n\nWith Darrell Castle, Gloria La Riva, and Rocky De La Fuente making their case to voters at the Free \u0026 Equal debate, Wikinews provided an opportunity to other presidential candidates who were not invited.\n\nThose making their final pleas include: America's Party nominee Tom Hoefling (who asked to use the same statement he made as a final plea as his party's nominee in 2012); Socialist Party USA and Natural Law Party presidential nominee Mimi Soltysik, and former Thompson Township, Fulton County, Pennsylvania Tax Assessor James Hedges, nominee of the Prohibition Party.\n\nBallot access maps for each of the three candidates appear above their respective statements.\n\n\"Without faith there can be no justice. The two things are inextricably linked.\n\n\"What is justice? To put it most simply, it is right-doing. In terms of the law and self-government, it is doing right to all persons equally and equitably.\n\n\"But how can we possibly perfect justice in this country, as the framers of our Constitution purposed to do, if we pay no mind to the laws of nature and of nature's God? It is not possible.\n\n\"Is there a desire in your heart to help save this country and restore America's greatness? Then trust God, seek His will, and do right. Join together with your fellow citizens who are of the same mind and heart, and retake the reins of your own self-government. If enough Americans will do this, without compromise, and do it in time, there is hope for this country and for our posterity. We can, if we choose to follow God and do right, once again be a shining city on a hill.\n\n\"But if we refuse, and choose instead to be faithless and unjust by continuing to kill the babies and destroy God's institution of marriage and the natural family, our children and grandchildren, those who survive our brutal savagery, will curse us. They will rightfully convict us of squandering their precious heritage, one that was dearly bought with blood, sweat, and tears by our just and faithful forebears.\n\n\"Our generation is a link in the chain between the past and the future. Please, my fellow Americans, I beg you, don't let it be broken. Strengthen the things that remain, before it is too late.\"\n\n\"Let the election be a reminder that no candidate will be able to provide the solutions to problems that are systemic. The effort to see the public focus on individuals is a con, a diversion. Please — don't fall for it. We aren't saying don't vote. What we are saying is that, if we are to see substantive change — the kinds of changes that are going to deliver peace — the people are going to lead the way. We can't vote peace into office. The capitalist system is inherently racist, sexist, exploitative, and oppressive. An individual can't change that. However, candidates need you [to] buy into the diversion to make sure they either maintain power or that they are elected into a position of power. Once the public starts focusing on the system, it's essentially a game over scenario for those who profit off of exploitation and oppression.\"\n\n\"If these two sleaze-balls are the best America has to offer, Heaven help the USA! Please send the major parties that message by voting for third-party candidates.\n\n\"If you live in one of the three states where the Prohibition Party is on the ballot, we would appreciate your choosing us. The Prohibition Party, America's oldest minor party, is the only party basing its platform on what is best for families and local communities. Our candidates, Jim Hedges (president) and Bill Bayes (vice-president), both have military backgrounds. They both support public education. They both believe in small government and local control. They practice decency and humility in their daily walks; neither has financial or personal baggage such as calls into question the integrity of the major-party candidates.\n\n\"Yes, 'Make America Great Again' by repudiating Trump and Clinton\"\n\nThis month, Wikinews asked recent interviewees to predict the results of the 2016 presidential election. Political consultant Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research; author and blogger Darryl Perry, a write-in candidate for president; and author and historian Darcy Richardson, a former candidate for the Reform Party presidential nomination; all weighed in with their predictions.\n\n██ Hillary Clinton (358)\n\n██ Donald Trump (174)\n\n██ Evan McMullin (6)\n\n\"With the caveat that pollsters hate predicting the future (haha), right now I'd say that Clinton carries every state that Obama carried in 2012, plus North Carolina and Arizona. Trump will carry the rest, except Utah, which Evan McMullin will narrowly win.\"\n\n██ Hillary Clinton (323)\n\n██ Donald Trump (215)\n\n\"I think the map from FiveThirtyEight.com will be mostly accurate. . . I know they're almost always correct. There may be a state or two that go in a different direction, but I'm not confident enough to say what state(s) will go to whom.\"\n\n██ Donald Trump (290)\n\n██ Hillary Clinton (248)\n\n\"Coupled with the fact that a vast majority of the electorate believes the country is headed in the wrong direction, the 2016 presidential campaign will be a resounding reaction to America’s tragic economic decline over the past three decades, if not longer. This long overdue reaction, borne of anger and frustration, will surprise only the pundits. To a certain extent, in fact, the results will be a sweeping repudiation of the mainstream media itself.\n\n\"Defying conventional wisdom and the preponderance of the national polls, I think Donald Trump will emerge victorious on Nov. 8th, amassing approximately 62.5 million votes to Hillary Clinton’s 59 million. With the exception of North Carolina (where the Democrats arguably have their strongest GOTV [get out to vote] effort), I think Trump will win all of the states carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, plus Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, giving the Republican nominee 290 electoral votes to Clinton’s 248.\"\n\nThis article features first-hand journalism by Wikinews members.

The company first announced the signalling fault on Twitter at 7:37 am, advising commuters to anticipate 10 additional minutes of travel time in the commute between Pasir Panjang and one-north stations. The fault was announced rectified two minutes later by another tweet from SMRT, though delays were still expected in the direction of Dhoby Ghaut station due to congestion at stations and on trains.\n\nFile photo of HarbourFront station, 2006.\n\nSMRT issued another tweet at 8:09 am, alerting commuters to another signalling fault affecting the CCL, on the stretch between Botanic Gardens and HarbourFront stations.\n\nInitially informing commuters that the issue would add 10 minutes of travel time along the affected stretch, the company later revised this to 20, and finally, 30 minutes in subsequent tweets, attributing the delays to \"intermittent signalling faults\".\n\nThe company later announced via Twitter service unavailable between Botanic Gardens and Marymount stations at 9:06 am, whilst offering free bus services along the length of the CCL. SMRT later amended the announcement in another tweet to encompass the stretch between Botanic Gardens and Serangoon stations. Train service was restored along the affected stretch by about 10:27 am.\n\nSMRT had previously experienced disruptions in service on the CCL for five consecutive days in September, also attributable to signalling issues, leading to authorities briefly switching off mobile signals at four CCL stations for two hours on September 2 during investigations. Most of the disruptions took place during peak hours, leading to suspicion the telecommunications network could be interfering with the train signalling system. After tests proved inconclusive following the lack of a disruption that day, the decision was made to turn off telecommunications signals in the event of another disruption.\n\n“It's very frustrating\", commented a commuter, 41-year-old Joseph Lim. \"The trains are sometimes moving and sometimes getting stuck. I don't know whether to stay on board. The communication has been insufficient\".\n\nAnother commuter, 29-year-old Alice Pan, stated, \"I am now stuck at the station with no way to get to work. I can't get on any SBS buses because they are full and there's no free shuttle bus in sight. I can't get any cabs either\". Pan was stranded in a train for an hour at Lorong Chuan station.\n\n36-year-old Sean Chew, said of his experience during the incident, \"I was stuck at Buona Vista for more than one hour. I didn't want to take the bus because it was very crowded. So no choice, had to wait [...] Luckily I just finished work.\"\n\nHowever, following the morning incidents, a stalled train on the East West MRT Line led to a half-hour disruption during the evening peak hour on the same day. SMRT informed commuters of the disruption, between Queenstown and Outram Park stations in the direction of Pasir Ris station, on Twitter at 5:48 pm, attributing it to a \"train fault\" at Tiong Bahru station. In the same tweet, SMRT estimated that the issue would be resolved around 6:10 pm. Due to the disruption, the company offered free bus services along the affected stretch in a subsequent tweet.\n\nAt 6:20 pm, SMRT announced on Twitter that it had cleared the disruption by removing the stalled train, and that trains were \"progressively return[ing] to normal speed\". The company continued to offer free bus services until 7 pm, when it announced the termination of the service on Twitter.\n\nIn the wake of yesterday's incidents, commuters criticized SMRT's handling of the matter on social media, citing SMRT's failure to provide sufficient information or sufficient buses for commuters, and uploading photos of the congestion.","description":"","keywords":"","time":1478185373,"url":"https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Signalling_issues_and_stalled_train_disrupt_service_on_Singapore%27s_Mass_Rapid_Transit_lines"},{"title":"Wikinews attends ComiCon in Tyler, Texas","body":"Jump to: ,\n\nCulture and entertainment\n\n10 September 2016: Ten-ton ice cube melting in Seattle park\n\n7 September 2016: Pop culture celebrated at Fan Expo Canada 2016 in Toronto\n\n2 August 2016: Debut from Booker-winner, final Canadian appearance of Stan Lee among announced Fan Expo Canada programming\n\n2 July 2016: '42-year detour' ends: Garrison Keillor homeward bound\n\n11 June 2016: Lawsuit filed against Ed Sheeran for his single Photograph\n\nPillars of Wikinews writing\n\nWriting an article\n\nWikinews attended the Rose City ComiCon comic-book convention in Tyler, Texas on Saturday.

Inter claimed a European treble in the 2009–2010 season under Portuguese manager José Mourinho. For the past five seasons, Nerazzurris have failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League. They have not finished higher than the fourth place in the league table for the last four seasons.\n\n46-year-old Dutchman de Boer was appointed in August but his team lost seven out of fourteen matches. de Boer had helped Amsterdam-based club AFC Ajax to win four consecutive Eredivisie — Dutch League titles.

So how can we use them most effectively?\n\nThe Paris accord was concluded by 196 governments last December, and came into force earlier this month. Now, its signatories are meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, for the annual United Nations climate change conference. Several conference events specifically focus on how countries can use natural systems to meet their CO2-reduction targets.\n\nWhile the climate-change challenge is immense, so, too, is the opportunity to accelerate sustainable development and ensure a better future for everyone on the planet. Under the Paris agreement, governments have committed to reducing their carbon emissions drastically, in order to keep global warming below 2°C. The vast majority of signatory countries have already presented national action plans for achieving this goal, and these plans will become more ambitious over time.\n\nThese Nationally Determined Contributions include renewable-energy targets and proposals for sustainable transportation, energy efficiency, and education. In addition, countries should consider adopting policies to manage natural capital better. The Paris agreement itself recognizes the important role that natural ecosystems play in limiting the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and governments should not neglect such powerful tools.\n\nGovernments will need to take action to conserve existing ecosystems – and restore and expand degraded ecosystems – in people-friendly ways. This is particularly true of wetlands, which include all land areas – such as lakes, floodplains, peatlands, mangroves, and coral reefs – that are covered with water, either seasonally or permanently.\n\nPeatlands are particularly important. Though they cover only 3% of the world’s total surface area, they store twice as much carbon as all forests combined. Peatland soils are composed of carbon – in the form of decomposed plant material – that has accumulated for thousands of years; and when peatlands are drained or burned, that carbon is released into the atmosphere. In fact, draining peatlands releases two times more carbon into the atmosphere than the aviation industry does.\n\nIn 2015, fires raged across Indonesia’s forested peatlands, raising concerns worldwide about how much carbon was being released into the atmosphere, to say nothing of the far-reaching health effects. Indonesia’s government estimates that peatland fires and deforestation alone account for more than 60% of the country’s total greenhouse-gas emissions.\n\nConserving and restoring peatlands could significantly reduce global CO2 emissions, which is why, in 2015, the Nordic Council of Ministers announced a commitment to preserve the region’s peatlands. Almost half of Nordic countries’ peatlands have been lost, and this ecosystem degradation contributes 25% of their total carbon emissions.\n\nThe Paris agreement entered fully into force in less than a year. This indicates that there is global momentum for concrete action to address the causes of climate change, as well as its effects, such as the disastrous floods, water shortages, and droughts already afflicting many countries.\n\nThat sense of urgency is not surprising. According to UN-Water, 90% of all natural hazards are water-related, and they will increase in frequency and intensity as climate change worsens. But natural systems can mitigate them: wetlands act as sponges that reduce flooding and delay the onset of droughts; and mangroves, salt marshes, and coral reefs all act as buffers that protect against storm surges. And wetlands, oceans, and forests do far more than just absorb and store carbon; they also provide fresh water, and are a food source for nearly three billion people.\n\nCountries have a readymade platform that they can use for their future wetland-conservation efforts. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, an intergovernmental treaty under which 169 countries have committed to conserve and sustainably manage their wetlands, is an ideal vehicle for help them reach their CO2-reduction targets, as well as meet the UN Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\n\nThe Paris agreement’s long-term objective is to achieve climate neutrality – no net greenhouse-gas emissions – in the second half of this century. Climate neutrality is necessary to keep global warming below 2°C; to reach it, we must reduce emissions to the point that they can be fully and easily absorbed by nature. This was the natural cycle for millions of years before anthropogenic climate change began.\n\nClimate neutrality can be achieved through political willpower, imaginative policies, new green technologies and clean-energy sources, and a multi-trillion-dollar shift in investment toward sustainable economic sectors and infrastructure. In addition, these measures’ success requires cost-effective investment in conservation efforts and expansion of natural capital. Only nature-based systems such as wetlands and forests can truly guarantee success – and a clean, prosperous future.","description":"The Paris climate agreement recognizes the role wetlands and other ecosystems play in limiting the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.

With the rentier systems that governments have maintained for decades now at a breaking point, policymakers must begin the difficult, but not impossible, process of establishing new social contracts.\n\nThat contract in Arab countries started to erode at the turn of the century, when governments with inflated budgets and bloated bureaucracies could no longer provide an adequate supply of basic services such as health care and education, create a sufficient number of jobs, or sustain food and fuel subsidies. But, despite diminished state benefits, most leaders have continued to insist that their countries’ people uphold their end of the contract by not participating meaningfully in public life.\n\nArab governments were able to sustain inefficient economies for decades because they were propped up by oil revenues. In recent decades, most Arab countries have benefited in some way from the Middle East’s abundant oil and gas reserves. Hydrocarbon-producing countries used their profits to buy their citizens’ loyalty and establish what were effectively welfare states; and non-oil producers enjoyed the benefits of aid, capital inflows, and remittances sent back by their nationals working in resource-rich countries.\n\nBecause the governments of oil-producing countries used revenues to provide for most of their people’s needs – including jobs, services, and favors – these governments fostered a culture of dependency, rather than encouraging self-reliance and entrepreneurship to expand the private sector. What’s more, because they did not need to tax their citizens to generate revenues, people had little recourse to challenge authoritarianism. The political culture reflected a simple principle: “no taxation, no representation.”\n\nNow that oil prices are declining and will likely continue to remain low for several years, if not permanently, the Middle East’s rentier systems face a significant challenge. Saudi Arabia, for example, is raising taxes, cutting domestic subsidies, and shifting its foreign-aid paradigm away from grants and toward investments. The kingdom has long provided financial support to Egypt, Jordan, and other countries in the region, so this shift will put pressure on those governments to pursue private-sector growth to improve their own countries’ economic performance.\n\nBut, while the Arab world’s governments have reached the limits of their ability to employ more people, raise public debt, and attract outside grants, members of these countries’ political and economic elite, whom the current rentier system privileges, will likely resist efforts at substantive reform. And we should expect to see further opposition from state bureaucracies, which lack any vision for a transition to an inclusive and sustainable economic model.\n\nStill, Middle Eastern countries cannot hope to develop prosperous economies without such a transition. After relying on resource rents for decades, these governments must switch not only to new growth models, but also to more representative governance. When Arab societies are asked to accept reduced subsidies, fewer government jobs, and less from the state in general, they will demand a larger share in the decision-making process.\n\nAs it stands, the Arab world is stuck between an unsustainable economic and political status quo and the inclusive, merit-based economic system that less myopic people in the region know must replace it. Too many Arab governments have put themselves in this untenable situation, having given little consideration to building the governance institutions their states need.\n\nThe first wave of Arab uprisings, which began in December 2010 and led to the 2011 Arab Spring, was a response to the breakdown of the old social contracts. In today’s perfect storm of declining oil prices and closed political systems, a new wave of protest could well emerge, particularly where governments have not recognized that the end of rentierism marks the end of the old social contract.\n\nFor these governments, economic reform is now a matter of survival. In a more open system, Arab governments will need to privatize many state-controlled companies, and make it far easier for entrepreneurs to register start-ups and launch new businesses. And, ultimately, Arab states’ economic reforms will succeed only if citizens gain a more powerful voice in governance.\n\nTunisia is the one country where a new social contract has begun to replace rentierism. The rest of the Arab world faces two alternatives. Its leaders can begin fighting the cancer of an unsustainable status quo, with all the pain and uncertainty that such a struggle entails; or they can wait for the cancer to become a terminal condition, and be devoured by it.","description":"If Middle Eastern countries do not start making real progress on fundamental political and economic reforms, further regional turmoil is inevitable.

In Brave New World, he described a human race that, by 2540, has been destroyed by ignorance, a lust for constant entertainment, the dominance of technology, and an overabundance of material goods. With Donald Trump’s recent election as president, the United States seems to be fulfilling Huxley’s prediction more than 500 years ahead of schedule.\n\nAmerica’s public culture has long shied away from highbrow thinking, often touting a kind of demotic laissez-faire egalitarianism as a precondition for unrestricted creativity and the unbridled capitalism that it supports. All anyone needs to get ahead are guts and perseverance.\n\nThat was once an attractive proposition for countries like the Soviet Union, which was closer to the world of George Orwell’s own dystopian novel 1984. In a place where government control had forced all cultural creativity underground, the demotic spirit and imagination that America seemed to embody seemed like a dream.\n\nBut in a world like Orwell’s, political pressure ultimately builds, and a surging dissident movement sweeps away the system, as the Soviet Union was in 1991. When people are distracted by mindless entertainment and piles of stuff, however, they lose their will to resist. Eventually, they are so lacking in knowledge and skills that they could not reject that life, even if they wanted to.\n\nIn other words, the world that Soviet citizens might have hoped for could represent a different sort of prison – less unpleasant, perhaps, but also more difficult to escape. That is what the US now faces.\n\nAmerica’s culture industry has long lent the country’s politics a tinge of Hollywood surrealism. Politicians are characters, from Jimmy Stewart’s morally incorruptible innocent in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” (1939) to Orson Welles’s Trumpian mogul in “Citizen Kane” (1941) and Robert Redford’s earnest crusader in “The Candidate” (1972), not to mention John Wayne’s many cowboys and rangers.\n\nWith the election of the young, tanned John F. Kennedy in 1960, the Hollywood aesthetic moved into the White House for the first time. In 1960, Kennedy was beamed into American homes, standing beside the better-known but far less charming Richard Nixon. More of a playboy than a cowboy, Kennedy captured American hearts. But he was no avatar of philistinism: on the contrary, he declared in 1963 that “ignorance and illiteracy…breed failures in our social and economic system.”\n\nAmerica’s next screen-friendly president was Ronald Reagan, an actual actor who had played an actual cowboy. But, when it came to openness and knowledge, his view was the opposite of JFK’s. Advocating supply-side economics to the white working class, he convinced millions that “less government,” which meant cutting federal programs, including education – would bring “morning in America.”\n\nWith his well-rehearsed sunny disposition, Reagan expertly played his role as president, but with a decidedly Hollywood flair. His Strategic Defense Initiative, intended to end the nuclear-deterrence strategy known as “mutual assured destruction,” was actually nicknamed “Star Wars.” Reagan’s enduring status as a Republican icon has much to do with his ability to dole out cowboy cruelty with movie-star charm, though luck also played a role. After all, victory in the Cold War was aided substantially by Mikhail Gorbachev, whose effort to reform the Soviet Union hastened its collapse.\n\nIn the wake of that victory, America doubled down on the proposition that daring beat knowing. James Carville, a campaign strategist for President Bill Clinton (who benefited from his own Southern-infused Kennedy-like charm), coined a phrase – “It’s the economy, stupid” – so catchy that it is frequently invoked to this day. And yet it is precisely the American economy that has dumbed so many down.\n\nBy 2000, Americans were ready for George W. Bush. At once a prince and an everyman, he combined his father’s East Coast blue-blood pedigree with a simple Texan persona, making him a perfect cross between Stewart and Wayne. But Bush was no movie star. Rather, he was an actor in an advertisement, hawking wars.\n\nToday, entertainment has entered a new phase – and so has politics. From reality television to summer blockbusters to social media, what occupies a growing number of people, especially in the US, is more unfiltered, instantaneous, and relentless than ever. The thirst for detailed knowledge and complex discussion seems to have been almost fully supplanted by a far more powerful thirst for memes, likes, and followers.\n\nEnter Trump. With his rowdy rallies and 140-character 2:30 a.m. “policy proposals,” the former reality television star knows exactly how to attract an angry population struggling to frame its grievances. Trump himself – who was rumored to have set his sights on launching “Trump TV” in the wake of the election (which he presumably expected to lose) – has attributed his election victory to social media.\n\nSome Trump voters claim that they were driven by “common sense,” and that what appealed to them was his message of “prosperity and reducing the debt,” together with “a strong military and reforming immigration.” But a closer look reveals that that message had no substance; indeed, it was barely coherent.\n\nWhat Trump supporters really voted for was the mean boss on “The Apprentice,” the decisive authoritarian who will fire – or deport – anyone, without a second thought. They voted for the guy they thought would follow Wayne’s swaggering mantra: “If everything isn’t black and white, I say, ‘Why the hell not?’” And many voted for a return to a time when white men were cowboys and conquerors.\n\nWith the election of Trump, who has named a white supremacist as his chief adviser and strategist, America could cross into Orwell territory. That would be devastating, but the silver lining is that, eventually, a resistance would rise up and destroy the system. But even if Trump stops short of neo-fascism, he could create an America that works for fewer and fewer people, while voters, so busy sharing cat pics and fake news on social media, gradually lose their remaining capacity to distinguish between lived reality and its virtual shadow.","description":"With the election of Trump, who has named a white supremacist as his chief adviser, America could become a very ugly country.

But, over time, the number of antibiotics to which bacteria are susceptible has been dwindling, and some pathogens have become resistant to most or all existing drugs. As a result, once-treatable infections are becoming deadly again.\n\nAlready, antibiotic resistance is leading to an estimated 700,000 deaths per year, with financial costs reaching tens of billions of dollars. As antibiotic resistance continues to undermine our ability to treat cancers, transplant organs, and implant prosthesis, these figures will only rise.\n\nMany factors have contributed to rising antibiotic resistance. Bacteria can reproduce and mutate rapidly, and they can establish something of a “genetic Internet” that enables certain pathogenic bacteria to “download” antibiotic-resistant genes. Moreover, most antibiotics are natural products of soil bacteria, in which antibiotic resistance can occur naturally. When human-made antibiotics were introduced on a massive scale, the bacteria with resistance became the most prevalent.\n\nToday, humans release about 100,000 tons of antibiotics per year. If those antibiotics were being used properly and saving lives, a reasonable cost-benefit analysis might be possible. But about 70% of them are used to make farm animals to grow a bit faster. The other 30%, while used to treat people, are often prescribed incorrectly or needlessly. And, because a substantial share of the used drugs are released into the environment with wastewater and manure, bacterial communities in soils, waters, and wildlife are also exposed.\n\nIf this abuse of antibiotics does not end, we will soon find ourselves without drugs to treat bacterial infections effectively. But while some steps are being taken – a high-level United Nations meeting last September produced proposals for some international measures – they are far from adequate.\n\nWhat is really needed is an immediate worldwide ban on the agricultural use of antibiotics. Moreover, guidelines for the clinical use of antibiotics, which the medical community now follows as closely as those concerning how to pick a necktie, must be reviewed and strongly enforced. These two measures alone – both of which could be enacted by governmental regulatory agencies – would reduce the use of antibiotics by nearly 80%, slowing the rise of antibiotic resistance substantially.\n\nOf course, getting governments to implement such measures will not be easy, because they run counter to powerful economic interests, the most obvious being the pharmaceutical industry, which sells $40 billion worth of antibiotics each year. While Big Pharma has a strong interest in continued antibiotic abuse, it has little interest in developing new antibiotics to tackle drug-resistant bacteria. Drugs for chronic illnesses and cancer are better for their bottom line.\n\nSo Big Pharma is seeking “incentives” to pursue research and development of new antibiotics, such as extended patents or tax breaks; the alternative would be to charge astronomical prices for new drugs. But the benefits of such incentives for pharmaceutical companies would far exceed the cost of the actual R\u0026D pursued; they would be instruments to funnel public funds into private hands – the very hands that caused the problem.\n\nBeyond all of these carrots, however, societies should consider using some sticks. I propose an initiative that rates pharmaceutical companies according to their contribution to solving the antibiotic-resistance problem; those that do not contribute should be punished with fewer sales. I call it NANBU (No Antibiotics, No Business).\n\nNANBU would grant points to companies with vigorous research programs or with new antibiotics in the development pipeline. Companies that do not manufacture or sell antibiotics for agricultural purposes, or that refuse to promote the use of antibiotics for diseases that do not require such drugs, would gain points as well. Those that engaged in the opposite behaviors – selling antibiotics as livestock “growth promoters” or actively encouraging physicians to prescribe the drugs – would lose points.\n\nAt first, virtually all drug companies would have negative scores. But, over time, the ratings could be adjusted, always according to scientifically sound advice from an independent group of experts. The ratings could then be used to guide drug-purchasing decisions.\n\nFor many kinds of relevant drugs, there are several options with similar efficacy and safety, produced by different companies. So clinicians could prescribe drugs mostly from highly rated companies, and avoid drugs from companies with low ratings. Patients could encourage such decision-making, and follow suit when purchasing over-the-counter drugs. Over time, antibiotics could become more profitable again, as engaged companies sell more of their other drugs and the need for costly incentives diminishes.\n\nThe key to NANBU’s success will be to ensure widespread understanding of the antibiotic-resistance threat and what is needed to combat it. This would give patients and doctors the impetus to regard NANBU ratings in making drug decisions, as well as to pressure their governments to take even stronger action. The use of a public awareness campaign to intensify pressure on governments to pursue necessary but difficult measures has worked before – for example, in advancing forest and fishery sustainability.\n\nPublic awareness was among the priorities highlighted at the UN meeting. To carry out that global effort, however, we need a new global institution that really is up to the task. NANBU, as an international NGO, would be able to cope with the transnational nature of most drug companies, while being protected from national-level lobbying or political pressure.\n\nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria represent a global threat, and therefore cannot be addressed with national measures alone. The world must think and act together to preserve the huge gains to human health and wellbeing that antibiotics have enabled.","description":"If the abuse of antibiotics does not end, we will soon find ourselves without drugs to treat bacterial infections effectively.

Even if they may not have stopped Trump, economists would have had a greater impact on the public debate had they stuck closer to their discipline’s teaching, instead of siding with globalization’s cheerleaders.\n\nAs my book Has Globalization Gone Too Far? went to press nearly two decades ago, I approached a well-known economist to ask him if he would provide an endorsement for the back cover. I claimed in the book that, in the absence of a more concerted government response, too much globalization would deepen societal cleavages, exacerbate distributional problems, and undermine domestic social bargains – arguments that have become conventional wisdom since.\n\nThe economist demurred. He said he didn’t really disagree with any of the analysis, but worried that my book would provide “ammunition for the barbarians.” Protectionists would latch on to the book’s arguments about the downsides of globalization to provide cover for their narrow, selfish agenda.\n\nIt’s a reaction I still get from my fellow economists. One of them will hesitantly raise his hand following a talk and ask: Don’t you worry that your arguments will be abused and serve the demagogues and populists you are decrying?\n\nThere is always a risk that our arguments will be hijacked in the public debate by those with whom we disagree. But I have never understood why many economists believe this implies we should skew our argument about trade in one particular direction. The implicit premise seems to be that there are barbarians on only one side of the trade debate. Apparently, those who complain about World Trade Organization rules or trade agreements are awful protectionists, while those who support them are always on the side of the angels.\n\nIn truth, many trade enthusiasts are no less motivated by their own narrow, selfish agendas. The pharmaceutical firms pursuing tougher patent rules, the banks pushing for unfettered access to foreign markets, or the multinationals seeking special arbitration tribunals have no greater regard for the public interest than the protectionists do. So when economists shade their arguments, they effectively favor one set of barbarians over another.\n\nIt has long been an unspoken rule of public engagement for economists that they should champion trade and not dwell too much on the fine print. This has produced a curious situation. The standard models of trade with which economists work typically yield sharp distributional effects: income losses by certain groups of producers or worker categories are the flip side of the “gains from trade.” And economists have long known that market failures – including poorly functioning labor markets, credit market imperfections, knowledge or environmental externalities, and monopolies – can interfere with reaping those gains.\n\nThey have also known that the economic benefits of trade agreements that reach beyond borders to shape domestic regulations – as with the tightening of patent rules or the harmonization of health and safety requirements – are fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nNonetheless, economists can be counted on to parrot the wonders of comparative advantage and free trade whenever trade agreements come up. They have consistently minimized distributional concerns, even though it is now clear that the distributional impact of, say, the North American Free Trade Agreement or China’s entry into the World Trade Organization were significant for the most directly affected communities in the United States. They have overstated the magnitude of aggregate gains from trade deals, though such gains have been relatively small since at least the 1990s. They have endorsed the propaganda portraying today’s trade deals as “free trade agreements,” even though Adam Smith and David Ricardo would turn over in their graves if they read the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nThis reluctance to be honest about trade has cost economists their credibility with the public. Worse still, it has fed their opponents’ narrative. Economists’ failure to provide the full picture on trade, with all of the necessary distinctions and caveats, has made it easier to tar trade, often wrongly, with all sorts of ill effects.\n\nFor example, as much as trade may have contributed to rising inequality, it is only one factor contributing to that broad trend – and in all likelihood a relatively minor one, compared to technology. Had economists been more upfront about the downside of trade, they may have had greater credibility as honest brokers in this debate.\n\nSimilarly, we might have had a more informed public discussion about social dumping if economists had been willing to recognize that imports from countries where labor rights are not protected do raise serious questions about distributive justice. It may have been possible then to distinguish cases where low wages in poor countries reflect low productivity from cases of genuine rights violations. And the bulk of trade that does not raise such concerns may have been better insulated from charges of “unfair trade.”\n\nLikewise, if economists had listened to their critics who warned about currency manipulation, trade imbalances, and job losses, instead of sticking to models that assumed away such problems, they might have been in a better position to counter excessive claims about the adverse impact of trade deals on employment.\n\nIn short, had economists gone public with the caveats, uncertainties, and skepticism of the seminar room, they might have become better defenders of the world economy.

But while gender is a strong marker for how Americans think about certain issues, it is not the best predictor of how they will vote. It turns out that female candidates do not face a single gender gap, but rather multiple gender gaps.\n\nTo be sure, a superficial look at past election results reveals an enormous and persistent difference between men and women voters overall. According to Pew Research, the last presidential election in which men and women voted the same was the 1976 contest between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. In this year’s election, women favored Clinton by 12 percentage points, and men favored Trump by the same margin. Men favored George W. Bush by 11 points in 2000, and women favored Obama by 13 points and 11 points in 2008 and 2012, respectively; but until now we have never seen double-digit gaps in both directions simultaneously.\n\nBut this still does not mean that the gender gap tells us much as a first-order factor, especially if we consider other gaps among demographic groups. If we sort by race or ethnicity, we find that white Americans favored Trump by 21 points, while Hispanics and African-Americans favored Clinton by 36 points and 80 points, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, voters with different education levels were further apart than in any election since 1980. College-educated voters backed Clinton by a nine-point margin, while people without a college degree backed Trump by an eight-point margin.\n\nA New York Times analysis of exit polls found that voters with annual incomes below $50,000 backed Clinton by about a ten-point margin, while voters with incomes above that level split evenly between the two candidates. This indicates that, at least in this year’s election, ethnicity and education were much more predictive than income.\n\nAs it happens, they were also more predictive than gender. Ninety-three percent of African-American women and 80% of African-American men voted for Clinton. But 53% of white women and 63% of white men voted for Trump, while only 43% of white women and 31% of white men voted for Clinton.\n\nSimilarly, Clinton won the support of white, college-educated women by six points; but she lost white non-college-educated women by 28 points and white non-college-educated men by 49 points. And if we look just at Republican voters, the gender gap vanishes almost entirely: 91% of Republican women and 92% of Republican men voted for Trump.\n\nThis all points not to a single gender dynamic, but to one refracted through multiple social and economic lenses. For example, as CBS News noted, Clinton’s failure to match President Barack Obama’s performance with African-American voters was “entirely due to black men” not voting for her – though why this was the case remains unexplained. And, despite her candidacy’s historic significance, Clinton’s performance with white women voters was no better than Obama’s performance in 2012.\n\nWe know that Republican women voted according to their party affiliation and not their gender. But Trump also seems to have reached white women not affiliated with a political party, perhaps owing to his campaign’s strategy of hyping women’s anxiety.\n\nThis strategy’s success indicates one way that gender can play a role in voter decision-making. Voter data going back 50 years suggests that women, more than men, are moved by the anxiety of changing circumstances and external threats.\n\nFor example, in the 1964 presidential election, Lyndon B. Johnson’s campaign aired the now-famous “Daisy” advertisement that suggested that his opponent, Barry Goldwater, would pull the US into a nuclear war; a week later, polls found that 45% of men, but 53% of women, shared that concern. Similarly, George W. Bush performed 30% better with women voters in his 2004 re-election campaign than he did in his 2000 campaign, which many political analysts attribute to anxieties among white middle-class “security moms” in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nStill more recently, in the 2014 US midterm elections, Republicans emphasized the US’s vulnerabilities, and aired advertisements hinting that the Islamic State was directing Ebola-infected agents to kill Americans. Experts ridiculed these claims, but polling suggests that the advertisements were nevertheless effective, and a number of Democratic incumbents, and women in particular, lost elections that year. The Democrats’ focus on reproductive rights had done little to sway women who were already worrying about the Islamic State and Ebola. As I warned at the time, the 2014 election was a trial run for a 2016 strategy to defeat a woman candidate.\n\nMany political observers assumed that this strategy could not possibly work for a Republican candidate who had suggested that a debate moderator was menstruating, joked about dating his daughter, was caught on tape boasting about groping women, and was publicly accused by several women of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nBut, just as in the 2014 election, Republican-leaning voters in 2016 were far more concerned about terrorism, crime, illegal immigration, and economic security than they were about issues such as sexism, racism, and inequality.\n\nWhere does this leave American women? A female US presidential candidate has now won a majority of women’s votes, and more total votes than her male opponent, and yet her strategy failed to deliver enough votes to secure a victory. In America’s polarized political culture, appeals to one group simply alienate other groups. As long as female candidates are forced to meet multiple, contradictory gender expectations, the US will never close the most prominent gap of all: that between America and the many countries that have already chosen a woman to lead them.","description":"It may seem surprising that only 54% of the female electorate in the US voted for Hillary Clinton, the first woman nominated for president by a major party.

After months of escalating protests and conflicts that have killed hundreds of people, on October 9 the Ethiopian government announced a state of emergency.\n\nEthiopia’s conflict is being driven partly by ethnic tensions and resentment against a small elite’s hold on the country’s wealth and power. But another crucial, if relatively overlooked, factor is Ethiopia’s land-management system. Indeed, the crisis began last year when a severe drought left ten million people hungry and triggered disputes over land ownership and protests against the government’s land-expropriation policies.\n\nEthiopia is hardly the only recent example of how conflicts over land rights can set the stage for political and humanitarian crises. Competition for arable land contributed to the Rwandan genocide in 1994. A historic drought may have created the conditions for Syria’s civil war. And food insecurity stemming from land mismanagement is an important factor driving migrants to Europe.\n\nLand-related issues will continue to threaten global stability, especially if the effects of climate change exacerbate existing problems. Deforestation and unsustainable land use have degraded soils, altered rainfall patterns, and increased the incidence of extreme weather events, especially in Africa. Continent-wide, 65% of land has been degraded, and 3% of agricultural GDP is lost annually, owing to soil and nutrient loss on farmland.\n\nIn Ethiopia, agriculture accounts for 80% of employment, so even slight drops in agricultural productivity can negatively affect income levels. And across Sub-Saharan Africa, damaged land is not only an environmental burden, but can also spell economic disaster. When trees and vegetation are cleared, heavy rainfall washes away the soil and destroys economic opportunities for local populations.\n\nI saw this firsthand in Kenya’s Tata Magadi gully, which extends for 104 miles (167 kilometers) and at first resembles the site of a meteor strike. Gullies are the ditches left after rainwater has washed away the topsoil. When they are large enough, they can sweep away entire homes and the productive farmland on which rural communities depend for their livelihoods.\n\nFortunately, there are ways to reverse land degradation, while simultaneously augmenting crop yields and household incomes. Tree planting on degraded land, for example, can increase agricultural productivity by anchoring farmland, increasing soil fertility, and providing shade for crops and livestock.\n\nAfter farmers in Malawi expanded their tree cover, crop yields increased by 50-100%. And, as a Kenyan maize farmer told me, “No trees, no rain.” Indeed, farmers have always intuitively known what scientists are now confirming: trees and other vegetation can stimulate more rainfall.\n\nTo accelerate restoration efforts in Africa, communities must be mobilized, and farmers must be empowered to restore their own land. This basic concept has gained traction in Kenya, where “community forest associations” have formed to protect and manage woodlands. In Ethiopia, every Abraha Atsbeha villager volunteers three days each month as part of a self-organized effort to rehabilitate the surrounding landscape; and other villages in the region have followed suit, giving rise to a growing local restoration movement.\n\nLand restoration is not just a technique to improve subsistence farming; it can also deliver financial returns for businesses and investors, which explains why many small and medium-size restoration enterprises have emerged. These include distributed plantations and sustainable-beekeeping companies, as well as Green Pot Enterprises, a fast-growing East African firm that leases shares of restoration sites to individuals, who can then collect an annual return on their investment. But for restoration businesses to scale up, they will need more access to growth capital and better-functioning domestic markets.\n\nNational governments also have an essential role to play, and 17 African countries have made commitments to restoration through the Bonn Challenge and the AFR100 initiative, which aims to restore 100 million hectares (247 million acres, or an area roughly the size of Ethiopia) in Africa by 2030. Africa’s proactive approach to restoration bodes well, because the effects of climate change are expected to hit the continent harder than any other world region.\n\nLand restoration is not a choice; it is a necessity. If African countries’ land is not salvaged, they will fall into a vicious cycle of poverty and political turmoil, similar to what we are now witnessing in Ethiopia. More severely degraded land is tougher to restore, so every day restoration is delayed is a lost opportunity for the environment, the economy, and peace.","description":"Ethiopia’s political crisis is being driven partly by ethnic tensions and resentment against a small elite’s hold on the country’s wealth and power; but a deeper contributing factor is land management.

Devastating extreme-weather events are already increasing in frequency, but much of the worst climate-related damage, such as a sustained rise in sea levels, will be recognized only once it is too late to act.Clearly, the climate system’s time horizon does not align well with the world’s much shorter political and economic cycles. Listed companies report on a quarterly basis, and recent regulatory changes, such as those mandating increased use of mark-to-market accounting, limit long-term thinking.Governments usually have legislative cycles of no more than four years, and they must also respond to immediate developments. Yet stabilizing the climate requires sustained and consistent action over an extended period.AXA and UBS, together with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), and the EU’s Climate-KIC (Knowledge and Information Community) recently organized a conference in Berlin. There, they discussed with leading experts in green investments and fossil-fuel divestment how financial intermediaries can help to address climate risks.The financial industry’s active involvement is urgently needed. In the Paris climate agreement reached last December, countries worldwide agreed to limit global warming to well below 2° Celsius, thereby defining the track on which the world must progress rapidly. Over the next 15 years, an estimated $93 trillion will be needed for investments in low-carbon infrastructure.Government funding alone cannot meet this demand, so the financial sector must help fill the gap. By redirecting capital flows toward proactive efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, financial institutions can protect client assets from global climate risks, and from the economic risks that will attend a warming planet. They are also demonstrating their social responsibility for the wellbeing of future generations.But financing change requires changing finance. And this process is already underway. Development institutions such as the World Bank are reconsidering their investment policies. And, in the private sector, there is growing enthusiasm for “green” bonds, loans, indices, and infrastructure investments.Still, as the European Commission notes, less than 1% of institutional assets worldwide are invested in environmentally friendly infrastructure assets. Given historically low interest rates and the general lack of attractive investment options, this is an ideal moment to tap into investors’ growing appetite for green financial products.Many large financial institutions have recently joined a global initiative promoting fossil-fuel divestment. Research findings indicate that global CO2 emissions must be restricted to less than one trillion metric tons between 2010 and the end of the century to comply with the Paris agreement and limit global warming to below 2°C. This means that most available coal, oil, and gas reserves must stay in the ground.As a result, investments in fossil-fuel energy sources will continue to lose value over time, eventually becoming stranded. Thus, the financial sector’s revaluation of such holdings not only helps to stabilize the climate, but also better protects its clients’ investments, and, by preventing the creation of a “carbon bubble,” helps to stabilize economies. But selling off these holdings will not suffice; the freed-up assets must also be redirected to more sustainable businesses.For financial institutions and investors to do their part, they urgently need a better understanding of the relevant climate-related investment risks, which the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has divided into three categories: physical, transitional, and liability. Informed investment decisions will require sound, scientifically grounded data and uniform standards to assess these risks, and to quantify opportunities against them.Effective disclosure will hence be a key part of any new framework. An FSB taskforce – comprising representatives from banks, insurers, institutional investors, rating agencies, consultants, and auditors – is currently shaping voluntary standards, so that companies provide consistent and comparable climate-related financial disclosures to their stakeholders, whether investors or lenders. This will also allow companies to gain valuable insights into their own potential for change, reflecting a time-honored principle: what gets measured, gets managed.This is no easy task. For example, carbon footprints on their own will not steer investments in the right direction. Instead of identifying the champions of environmentally friendly solutions, these figures merely reveal which companies currently emit the most greenhouse gases. Meaningful disclosure standards must take account of sector-specific information and the impact on business strategies of the transition toward a low-carbon economy.All the governments that signed the Paris agreement can now be expected to adopt a range of measures to enable them to implement their de-carbonization strategies. In this context, carbon pricing will be an essential part of the policy toolbox. Some governments have already taken steps to promote the development of green products, via tax or market incentives. Overall, such changes to legal frameworks must support, not impede, the private financial sector’s efforts to tackle climate change.\n\nFinancing the infrastructure projects that are too expensive for some national governments to finance on their own, but that are essential to the transformation of our energy system – such as wind farms and long-distance power lines – will require a new class of global infrastructure bonds. In the past, governments have encouraged investment in government bonds. Now, in order to increase private investment in building up clean infrastructure, investor-protection measures and dispute-resolution mechanisms must be considered.The financial sector is ready to spearhead the shift to sustainability. When Germany takes over the G20 presidency next year, it will have the opportunity to convince its partners to create an adequate framework to encourage change in the financial sector that ensures a smooth adjustment to a low-carbon economy. For both public and private actors, the time to act is now.","description":"Government funding alone cannot bring about a clean-energy economy, so the financial sector must help fill the gap.

No one wants to legalize coercion, violence, or fraud in the sex industry, or the use of sex workers who are not adults. But some organizations campaigning against trafficking understand that when sex work is illegal, it is much riskier for sex workers to complain to the authorities when they are enslaved, beaten, or cheated. For that reason, the International Secretariat of the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women applauded Amnesty International for supporting decriminalization.\n\nThere was also opposition from some feminist organizations, which accused Amnesty of protecting “the rights of pimps and johns.” Instead, they argued, we should “end the demand for paid sex” – but without explaining how this is to be done.\n\nIn species that reproduce sexually, sex is, for obvious reasons, one of the strongest and most pervasive desires. Humans are no exception in this respect. In every modern society, humans exchange money or other valued items for things that they desire and could not otherwise obtain. For various reasons, a significant number of people cannot get sex, or sufficient sex, or the kind of sex they want, freely. Unless at least one of these conditions changes, demand for paid sex will continue. I find it hard to see how any of them will change sufficiently to eliminate that demand.\n\nIf demand for paid sex is likely to continue, what about the supply? Another response to proposals to decriminalize sex work is that we should instead change the conditions that lead people to sell their bodies. This assumes that only those who lack any other means of supporting themselves would engage in sex for money.\n\nThat assumption is a myth. Leaving aside sex workers who want money because they have expensive drug habits, some could get a job in a factory or a fast-food restaurant. Faced with the prospect of monotonous, repetitive work for eight hours a day on an assembly line or flipping hamburgers, they prefer the higher pay and shorter hours that the sex industry offers. Many may not make that choice, but should we make criminals of those who do?\n\nIt’s not a crazy choice. Contrary to stereotypes of paid sex, work in a legal brothel is not especially dangerous or hazardous to one’s health. Some sex workers view their profession as involving greater skill and even a more human touch than alternative jobs open to them. They take pride in their ability to give not only physical pleasure, but also emotional support, to needy people who cannot get sex any other way.\n\nIf sex work is not going to disappear anytime soon, anyone who cares about the health and safety of sex workers – not to mention their rights – should support moves to make it a fully legal industry. That is what most sex workers want as well. In the same month that decriminalization became Amnesty’s official policy, the conservative government of New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state, decided not to regulate that state’s previously legalized sex industry. Jules Kim, the CEO of Scarlet Alliance, the Australian Sex Workers Association, greeted the news with relief, saying that decriminalization had delivered “outstanding outcomes for sex workers’ health and safety.”\n\nThe Sex Workers Outreach Project agreed that decriminalization led to better health for sex workers, and enabled them to be covered by the standard features of the labor market, including insurance, occupational health and safety programs, and rules of fair trading. A majority of Australians now live in states that have legalized or decriminalized sex work.\n\nThis is consistent with the growing recognition in recent years that the state should be extremely reluctant to criminalize activities freely entered into by consenting adults. Laws against sodomy have been abolished in most secular countries. Physician-assisted dying is legal in an increasing number of jurisdictions. In the United States, there is widespread support for the legalization of marijuana.\n\nThe repeal of restrictive legislation has practical benefits, in addition to extending individual liberty. In Colorado, the desire to tax the marijuana industry was a major motivation for legalization. The original impetus for the legalization of the sex industry in New South Wales was an inquiry into police corruption that showed that the sex industry was a major source of police bribes. Legalization ended that in a single stroke.\n\nCountries that criminalize the sex industry should consider the harms these laws cause, as Amnesty International has done. It is time to put aside moralistic prejudices, whether based on religion or an idealistic form of feminism, and do what is in the best interests of sex workers and the public as a whole.","description":"Amnesty International's appeal in May for governments to decriminalize sex work was met with a storm of protest.

How will President-elect Trump represent those who put him in power – and how will his power affect America and the world?\n\nNOV 13, 2016\n\nAll US presidents come to power – and exercise it – by assembling and sustaining a broad electoral coalition of voters with identifiable interests. Donald Trump is no exception. Trump’s stunning election victory, following a populist campaign that targeted US institutions, domestic and foreign policies, and especially elites, was powered by voters – overwhelmingly white, largely rural, and with only some or no postsecondary education – who feel alienated from a political establishment that has failed to address their interests.So the question now, for the United States and the world, is how Trump intends to represent this electoral bloc. Part of the difficulty in answering it, as Project Syndicate’s contributors understand well, is Trump himself. “The US has never before had a president with no political or military experience, nor one who so routinely shirks the truth, embraces conspiracy theories, and contradicts himself,” notes Harvard’s Jeffrey Frankel. But, arguably more important, much of what Trump has promised – on trade, taxation, health care, and much else – either would not improve his voters’ economic wellbeing or would cause it to deteriorate further.This paradox lies at the root of some unsettling scenarios. As Princeton University’s Jan-Werner Mueller points out, “[t]here is substantial evidence that low-income groups in the US have little to no influence on policy and go effectively unrepresented in Washington.” But Trump’s claim to represent his voters is not based on “demanding a fairer system.” Instead, says Mueller, Trump “tells the downtrodden that only they are the ‘real people,’” and that (as Trump put it during his campaign), “the other people don’t mean anything.” By persuading his supporters “to view themselves as part of a white nationalist movement,” Mueller argues, a “claim about identity is supposed to solve the problem that many people’s interests are neglected.”\n\nTo continue reading, please log in or provide your email address Receive our Sunday newsletter Receive our PS On Point newsletter Registration is free and gives you access to our newsletters, unlimited access to our archive, commenting rights, and more.","description":"The global shock administered by Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency continues to reverberate.

Rather, it was a community that embraced shared hopes and values. Reflecting America’s global leadership after World War II, the West was protected by US hard power and shaped by US soft power. And it was the most peaceful and prosperous place in the world.\n\nThe West has long provided the foundation for the global order – probably the most successful such foundation ever created. Led by the US, the West built, shaped, and championed international institutions, cooperative arrangements, and common approaches to common problems. As it helped to sustain peace and boost prosperity in much of the world, its approaches and principles attracted millions of followers.\n\nThe election of Donald Trump as US President, however, threatens this entire system. If Trump does in office what he promised to do during his crude and mendacious campaign, he could wreck a highly sophisticated creation, one that took several decades to develop and has benefited billions of people. Those of us who, like Americans, have gained from it must fight for it while it still breathes.\n\nOne promise on which Trump must not follow through is to advance trade protectionism. The case for tearing up free-trade agreements and aborting negotiations for new ones is premised on the belief that globalization is the reason for rising income inequality, which has left the American working class economically marooned. But the real sources of American workers’ economic pain are technological innovation and tax-and-spend policies that favor the rich.\n\nIf Trump, say, walks away from the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada, turns his back on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and challenges the World Trade Organization, he will hurt the very people who voted for him. And he will lose friends and influence abroad.\n\nAnother dangerous policy that Trump could pursue would be to back away from America’s security arrangements with countries like Japan and South Korea, as well as with NATO. In Trump’s distorted view, the US should not be offering “free” security to its allies, and instead should leave them to fend for themselves.\n\nIn practice, such a stance would be highly destabilizing. Eastern Europe and the Baltic states would be at the mercy of Russia. And Asia and the Middle East would be at risk of nuclear proliferation, as countries lacking the US security backstop would seek to develop their own nuclear arsenals – an approach that Trump has said would be acceptable.\n\nTrump’s pledge to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran is a case in point. Does anyone think Saudi Arabia would sit still if Iran restarted its weapons program? Criticizing the agreement – a major achievement of US President Barack Obama – might have served Trump during the campaign, but actually abrogating the deal would make the world a far more dangerous place.\n\nTrump’s stated approach to climate change is just as problematic. He has declared his intention to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, aimed at reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and staving off catastrophic climate change. He has already appointed Myron Ebell, an outspoken climate change denier, to oversee the transition at the US Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nTrump bases this approach on the nonsensical belief that human-driven climate change is a hoax, invented by the Chinese to make US industry less competitive. And that is far from the only accusation Trump has hurled at China. His generally hostile attitude toward the country, particularly with regard to trade, threatens further damage to an already-tense bilateral relationship – and thus poses a risk for US multinationals and US allies alike.\n\nA Trump presidency also poses something of an existential threat. His derogatory comments about marginalized groups – including Muslims, Mexicans, women, and people with disabilities – imperil the values that are fundamental to America’s identity and place in the world, and that bind the countries of the West together.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is one leader who seems to recognize how quickly the collapse of US leadership could bring about the end of the post-1945 global order. Her response to Trump’s victory was eloquent and powerful: “Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom, and respect for the law and the dignity of man, independent of origin, skin color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or political views.” On the basis of those values, she declared, she would work with Trump.\n\nThat is precisely how all of America’s allies and friends should be responding. Like Merkel, we should all speak up for all that the West has stood for, and all that it has achieved. We must condemn any move by Trump to shirk the rule of law and the norms of a free society. We must argue the case for free trade, which has brought far-reaching benefits to humanity. And we must fight to uphold the nuclear deal with Iran and nuclear non-proliferation around the world.\n\nThere is also an imperative to reiterate our commitment to stand firm against Russian adventurism in Eastern and Central Europe. In particular, we must make clear that Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty applies to Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Poland – all members of the military alliance that the US still leads. (It would also help if, after years of backsliding, NATO’s European members upped their contributions to our collective defense.)\n\nFinally, we should assert that, while we in the West do not agree with China’s mercantilist policies and repressive measures at home, we want to work with it, not seek to marginalize and humiliate it.\n\nThe idea of “the West” is one of America’s finest achievements (though many other countries have also contributed). It would be a true disaster for the world if America, in an act of self-destructive decadence, tossed this noble, practical, and inspiring creation into the dustbin of history.","description":"Led by the US, the West has for decades cultivated a global order that has benefited billions.

It is not just a feeling; many Americans really have been left behind. It can be seen in the data no less clearly than in their anger. And, as I have argued repeatedly, an economic system that doesn’t “deliver” for large parts of the population is a failed economic system. So what should President-elect Trump do about it?\n\nOver the last third of a century, the rules of America’s economic system have been rewritten in ways that serve a few at the top, while harming the economy as a whole, and especially the bottom 80%. The irony of Trump’s victory is that it was the Republican Party he now leads that pushed for extreme globalization and against the policy frameworks that would have mitigated the trauma associated it. But history matters: China and India are now integrated into the global economy. Besides, technology has been advancing so fast that the number of jobs globally in manufacturing is declining.\n\nThe implication is that there is no way Trump can bring a significant number of well-paying manufacturing jobs back to the US. He can bring manufacturing back, through advanced manufacturing, but there will be few jobs. And he can bring jobs back, but they will be low-wage jobs, not the high-paying jobs of the 1950’s.\n\nIf Trump is serious about tackling inequality, he must rewrite the rules yet again, in a way that serves all of society, not just people like him.\n\nThe first order of business is to boost investment, thereby restoring robust long-term growth. Specifically, Trump should emphasize spending on infrastructure and research. Shockingly for a country whose economic success is based on technological innovation, the GDP share of investment in basic research is lower today than it was a half-century ago.\n\nImproved infrastructure would enhance the returns from private investment, which has been lagging as well. Ensuring greater financial access for small and medium-size enterprises, including those headed by women, would also stimulate private investment. A carbon tax would provide a welfare trifecta: higher growth as firms retrofit to reflect the increased costs of carbon dioxide emissions; a cleaner environment; and revenue that could be used to finance infrastructure and direct efforts to narrow America’s economic divide. But, given Trump’s position as a climate change denier, he is unlikely to take advantage of this (which could also induce the world to start imposing tariffs against US products made in ways that violate global climate-change rules).\n\nA comprehensive approach is also needed to improve America’s income distribution, which is one of the worst among advanced economies. While Trump has promised to raise the minimum wage, he is unlikely to undertake other critical changes, like strengthening workers’ collective-bargaining rights and negotiating power, and restraining CEO compensation and financialization.\n\nRegulatory reform must move beyond limiting the damage that the financial sector can do and ensure that the sector genuinely serves society.\n\nIn April, President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers released a brief showing increasing market concentration in many sectors. That means less competition and higher prices – as sure a way to lower real incomes as lowering wages directly. The US needs to tackle these concentrations of market power, including the newest manifestations in the so-called sharing economy.\n\nAmerica’s regressive tax system – which fuels inequality by helping the rich (but no one else) get richer – must also be reformed. An obvious target should be to eliminate the special treatment of capital gains and dividends. Another is to ensure that companies pay taxes – perhaps by lowering the corporate-tax rate for companies that invest and create jobs in America, and raising it for those that do not. As a major beneficiary of this system, however, Trump’s pledges to pursue reforms that benefit ordinary Americans are not credible; as usual with Republicans, tax changes will largely benefit the rich.\n\nTrump will probably also fall short on enhancing equality of opportunity. Ensuring preschool education for all and investing more in public schools is essential if the US is to avoid becoming a neo-feudal country where advantages and disadvantages are passed on from one generation to the next. But Trump has been virtually silent on this topic.\n\nRestoring shared prosperity would require policies that expand access to affordable housing and medical care, secure retirement with a modicum of dignity, and allow every American, regardless of family wealth, to afford a post-secondary education commensurate with his or her abilities and interests. But while I could see Trump, a real-estate magnate, supporting a massive housing program (with most of the benefits going to developers like himself), his promised repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) would leave millions of Americans without health insurance. (Soon after the election, he suggested he may move cautiously in this area.)\n\nThe problems posed by the disaffected Americans – resulting from decades of neglect – will not be solved quickly or by conventional tools. An effective strategy will need to consider more unconventional solutions, which Republican corporate interests are unlikely to favor. For example, individuals could be allowed to increase their retirement security by putting more money into their Social Security accounts, with commensurate increases in pension benefits. And comprehensive family and sick leave policies would help Americans achieve a less stressful work/life balance.\n\nLikewise, a public option for housing finance could entitle anyone who has paid taxes regularly to a 20% down-payment mortgage, commensurate with their ability to service the debt, at an interest rate slightly higher than that at which the government can borrow and service its own debt. Payments would be channeled through the income-tax system.\n\nMuch has changed since President Ronald Reagan began hollowing out the middle class and skewing the benefits of growth to those at the top, and US policies and institutions have not kept pace. From the role of women in the workforce to the rise of the Internet to increasing cultural diversity, twenty-first century America is fundamentally different from the America of the 1980s.\n\nIf Trump actually wants to help those who have been left behind, he must go beyond the ideological battles of the past. The agenda I have just sketched is not only about the economy: it is about nurturing a dynamic, open, and just society that fulfills the promise of Americans’ most cherished values. But while it is, in some ways, somewhat consistent with Trump’s campaign promises, in many other ways, it is the antithesis of them.\n\nMy very cloudy crystal ball shows a rewriting of the rules, but not to correct the grave mistakes of the Reagan revolution, a milestone on the sordid journey that left so many behind. Rather, the new rules will make the situation worse, excluding even more people from the American dream.","description":"Donald Trump’s astonishing victory in the US presidential election has made one thing abundantly clear: too many Americans – particularly white male Americans – feel left behind. Unfortunately, he is unlikely to pursue the policy agenda his voters need.","keywords":"Joseph E. Stiglitz,trump,inequality,jobs,globalization,tax","time":1479029400,"url":"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/trump-agenda-america-economy-by-joseph-e--stiglitz-2016-11"},{"title":"Unchecked Trump?","body":"NEW YORK – How has the 2016 election in the United States – which gave the Republican Party control of the presidency, the Senate, and the House of Representatives – affected the much-touted system of checks and balances as set out in the country’s constitution? In my view, it has virtually eliminated them.\n\nThe checks and balances generated by the judicial branch are certainly in danger. Anything less than constant Democratic filibusters will allow Republicans to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court that they have blocked Democratic President Barack Obama from filling. And the aging Supreme Court may soon have more slots open – slots currently held by liberal and centrist justices. Republicans therefore have a good chance of creating a conservative majority on the nine-member Supreme Court that may last for decades, especially if they win the presidency again in 2020.\n\nThat majority may erode democratic checks, such as the campaign-finance limits that were dealt a devastating blow by the 2010 Citizens United decision. In a 5-4 majority, the Court ruled that corporations are “associations of individuals,” and thus that any limits on the amount of money corporations could spend on political campaigns violated their First Amendment right to freedom of expression.\n\nRepublican obstructionism in the Senate has also put other levels of the federal judiciary at risk. During President Barack Obama’s second term in office, the rate at which vacancies in the US District and Circuit Courts were filled fell to its lowest point in 50 years. Trump can now fill rapidly these vacancies with conservative judges who may well erode checks and balances further.\n\nState-generated checks and balances will not escape unscathed, either. Indeed, given new partisan alignments at the state level – Republicans now control an all-time high of 68 of the 99 state legislative chambers and 33 of the 50 governorships – the possibility that states will challenge the federal government is substantially reduced.\n\nThis has long-term implications. Since 2013, when another close Supreme Court decision gutted the Voting Rights Act, many, if not most, states with Republican majorities in both chambers have enacted laws and regulations that suppress voting. Such rules include reducing the number of polling stations in minority-dominated areas; requiring photo IDs, such as driver’s licenses, which many minority members do not have; and eliminating both same-day registration and Sunday voting, historically popular among minorities.\n\nA federal appeals court justice struck down a North Carolina law of this sort, because it suppressed African-American turnout with “almost surgical precision.” But if Republicans appoint more judges, such checks will grow rarer. And if voter suppression helps Republicans to win control of more and more state legislatures, more such laws could be enacted.\n\nThere is some reason for hope: the ultimate source of checks and balances is the US constitution, which is the hardest of all democratic constitutions to change. To amend it by the normal route requires, among other things, a supermajority of two-thirds in the House of Representatives and the Senate, where the Republicans have nowhere near that kind of dominance.\n\nThe other route to constitutional amendment is a vote by two-thirds of state legislatures (34 out of 50 states) to call on Congress to hold a constitutional convention, which then must put forward an amendment that is subsequently ratified by three-quarters of the state legislatures or state conventions. No amendment in US history has ever been approved by this route. But, while the Republicans would need to gain control over at least three or four more legislatures to make a credible attempt, the possibility that they could pursue such a strategy should worry people more than it does.\n\nBarring an amendment, the US is protected from some of Trump’s most egregious campaign promises. Proposals like restricting immigration on the basis of religion are unconstitutional. Other damaging proposals can be filibustered by Democrats in the Senate, where Republicans do not have the 60 votes needed to stop them.\n\nTo be sure, filibusters could be abolished at the start of the 2017-2018 Senate session. But Republican leaders must worry about a future in which they are in opposition and want to use the filibuster themselves. If they did make such a move, however, they would greatly reduce the Democrats’ oppositional power over the next few years.\n\nIn foreign policy, the US has always had few checks on the president, though some external limitations may apply. For example, Trump cannot fulfill his campaign promise immediately to trash the Paris climate agreement – an international deal that all signatories are legally bound to respect for at least four years. He could, however, undermine it, such as by indicating to countries like India that the US will not fulfill its commitments.\n\nIn domestic policy, however, Trump will have great scope to act. Most vulnerable is the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which has given health-care coverage to 20 million previously uninsured citizens. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reforms, aimed at controlling banks and other financial institutions that are “too big to fail,” is also at risk of being undone.\n\nFor concerned citizens who want to reestablish checks and balances in America, there are three urgent tasks. First, they should start laying the groundwork to win at least three more Senate seats in 2018. Second, they should act to prevent Republicans from gaining control of three-quarters of state legislatures, thereby opening the way for constitutional amendments. And, third, they must mobilize more of their fellow citizens to reject authoritarian-style tactics and policies and support more inclusive democratic alternatives.\n\nThe existence of compelling alternatives is the most important check on populist politicians with authoritarian tendencies who win power through the vote. By the next presidential election, US voters, like their British counterparts who voted in favor of Brexit, may be experiencing “buyer’s remorse.” But this is not enough; attractive and credible alternatives must be forged.","description":"The US political system's checks and balances on government power had been weakened before the 2016 election.

And when it comes to exercising harder power – doing what it takes to counter serious challenges to peace and security – there will be little confidence in Trump’s judgment, given that almost every statement he made during his campaign was either wildly contradictory or downright alarming.\n\nMaintaining security, stability, and prosperity in Asia requires a cooperative environment, in which countries secure their national interests through partnerships – not rivalries – and trade freely with one another. The only grounds for confidence on this front after Trump’s victory is that he may actually do none of the things he said he would, such as starting a trade war with China, walking away from alliance commitments, and supporting Japan and South Korea going nuclear.\n\nWith little or no hard knowledge of international affairs, Trump is relying on instincts that are all over the map. He combines “America first” isolationist rhetoric with muscular talk of “making America great again.” Staking out impossibly extreme positions that you can readily abandon may work in negotiating property deals; but it is not a sound basis for conducting foreign policy.\n\nTrump’s dangerous instincts may be bridled if he is capable of assembling an experienced and sophisticated team of foreign-policy advisers. But this remains to be seen, and the US Constitution grants him extraordinary personal power as Commander-in-Chief, if he chooses to exercise it.\n\nUS leadership in Asia is a double-edged sword. Noisy assertions of continued primacy are counterproductive. China’s legitimate demand to be accepted as a joint rule-maker, not just a rule-follower, has to be recognized. But when China overreaches, as it has done with its territorial assertions in the South China Sea, there does need to be pushback. On that front, a quiet but firm US role remains necessary and welcome.\n\nShortly after former President Bill Clinton left office, I heard him say privately (though never publicly) that the US could choose to use its “great and unrivaled economic and military power to try to stay top dog on the global block in perpetuity.” A better choice, however, would be “to try to create a world in which we will be comfortable living, when we are no longer top dog on the global block.” That kind of language seems to be anathema for anyone holding high office in the US, at least publicly. But it is what Asia wants to hear.\n\nFor Australia and other US allies and partners in the region, this presidential election makes it clear that we can no longer – assuming we ever could – take coherent, smart American leadership for granted. We must do more for ourselves and work together more, while relying less on the US.\n\nTrump will probably have more instinctive sympathy for Australia than he will for many other US allies. We are seen as paying our alliance dues, not least by having fought alongside the US in every one of its foreign wars – for better or worse – over the past century. And, as cohabitants in the Anglosphere, we are in Trump’s cultural comfort zone. But Australia will be anything but comfortable if the larger regional dynamics go off the rails.\n\nWe should have learned by now that the US, under administrations with far more prima facie credibility than Trump’s, is perfectly capable of making terrible mistakes, such as the wars in Vietnam and Iraq. We now have to be ready for American blunders as bad as, or worse than, in the past. We will have to make our own judgments about how to react to events, based on our own national interests.\n\nThis does not mean that Australia should walk away from its alliance with the US. But we will need to be more skeptical of American policies and actions than in recent decades. Australia should become much more self-consciously independent, and assign much higher priority to building closer trade and security ties with Japan, South Korea, India, and especially Indonesia, our huge near-neighbor.\n\nNo one should give ground if China overreaches, and Australia should, now more than ever, work closely with our Asian neighbors to ensure that it does not. But we must also recognize the legitimacy of China’s new great-power aspirations, and engage with it non-confrontationally. We will all benefit from a common regional-security framework based on mutual respect and reciprocity, not least when confronting regional threats such as North Korea’s nuclear chest-beating.\n\nWe can only hope that Trump will dispel our worst fears when he is in office. But in the meantime, Australian and other regional policymakers should adhere to a simple mantra: More self-reliance. More Asia. Less US.","description":"Whether or not US President-elect Donald Trump behaves better once in office than he did on the campaign trail, America’s global authority has already diminished, especially in Asia.

In fact, his rise threatens to incite a revolution that shakes the foundations not only of American politics, but also of global peace and prosperity. One region that is likely to start feeling tremors soon is Southeast Asia.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump espoused an “America first” worldview, emphasizing that he would follow through on US international commitments only when it suits him. This has rattled many a US ally and partner, including the countries of Southeast Asia, which fear that they will be all but ignored by a key guarantor of stability in their neighborhood.\n\nThis would represent a notable reversal from the last eight years, during which President Barack Obama made a concerted effort to deepen America’s ties with Southeast Asia. Under Obama’s stewardship, the US acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and joined the East Asia Summit.\n\nMoreover, in 2013, the US became the first ASEAN dialogue partner to establish a permanent mission to the organization. Last year, the country forged a strategic partnership with ASEAN. And, earlier this year, Obama hosted the first US-ASEAN summit on American soil. Obama also brought four ASEAN members into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a mega-regional trade deal that would promote US economic exchange with the region.\n\nObama also helped to cement bilateral ties with most countries in the region, visiting nine out of ten during his two terms in office. Had a US government shutdown not forced him to cancel a trip to Brunei in 2013, he would have had a perfect record.\n\nTo be sure, America’s ties with Thailand and the Philippines have deteriorated somewhat during Obama’s second term, owing to the US president’s criticism of violations of democratic norms and human rights in both countries. But that regression has been more than offset by progress in America’s relationships with Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, and especially Vietnam.\n\nObama’s efforts in Southeast Asia were all part of his broader strategic “pivot” to Asia, announced in 2011. Aimed at helping the US to maintain its strategic primacy in the Asia-Pacific region, the policy has been quietly welcomed by most regional actors, as it dovetails with their desire to check China’s hegemonic ambitions in the region.\n\nAll of this may be about to change. Trump is likely to focus overwhelmingly on domestic issues, at the expense of America’s strategic interests abroad. Indeed, he may well back away from strategic engagement with ASEAN and its members, causing their relationships with the US to deteriorate. If he fails to show up at important regional meetings like the East Asian Summits, that deterioration will become even more pronounced.\n\nTrump’s indifferent attitude will also hurt bilateral relations. To be sure, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines may prefer a US president who does not trouble himself to criticize their governments’ human-rights abuses, corruption, or constitutional shenanigans. But US relations with other countries in the region may stall, if not deteriorate, as confidence in Trump’s willingness to follow through on US commitments collapses.\n\nEconomic ties are also likely to suffer. Under Trump, who has revealed strong protectionist tendencies, the TPP will stay moribund, at best. The US-ASEAN Connect initiative, which Obama proposed at the summit earlier this year, and which aims to boost America’s economic engagement with the regional grouping, may also go nowhere.\n\nIt is not only Southeast Asia that will suffer from Trump’s indifference. Australia, India, and Japan – key US allies and security partners in the Asia-Pacific region – may also find it difficult to connect with Trump, further undermining faith in the US-led regional security architecture. The strategic rebalancing toward Asia that Obama worked so hard to advance may be thrown into reverse, dealing a heavy blow to Asia and the US alike.\n\nOne Asian country that may welcome the election’s outcome is China. Although Trump has criticized China extensively for supposedly stealing American jobs – and even blamed it for creating the “hoax” of climate change – he may take a softer stance on Chinese strategic expansionism in the region, especially in the South China Sea, than Obama did.\n\nIn a far-fetched but not implausible scenario, Trump may even strike a deal with China over its territorial claims, disregarding the interests of US allies, from Japan to the Philippines. Such a move would be particularly devastating to perceptions of Trump’s America in Southeast Asia.\n\nThe good news is that this outcome is not guaranteed. Campaign rhetoric is one thing; governing is quite another. Once in the White House, a heavily advised Trump may realize that maintaining some continuity in America’s foreign policy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, is more in line with US interests than the alternative. If nothing else, Trump may resist the idea of China gaining strategic primacy in the region.\n\nFor Trump, who made his career in real estate, perhaps the best way to look at it is in business terms. The US would be remiss to squander all the significant investment that his predecessor has made in Southeast Asia.","description":"US President-elect Donald Trump's rise threatens to incite a revolution that shakes the foundations not only of American politics, but also of global peace and prosperity.

Of course, he is nothing of the sort. He campaigned against the political establishment, and, as he told a pre-election rally, a victory for him would be a “Brexit plus, plus, plus.” With two political earthquakes within months of each other, and more sure to follow, we may well agree with the verdict of France’s ambassador to the United States: the world as we know it “is crumbling before our eyes.”The last time this seemed to be happening was the era of the two world wars, 1914 to 1945. The sense then of a “crumbling” world was captured by William Butler Yeats’s 1919 poem “The Second Coming”: “Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;/Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.” With the traditional institutions of rule thoroughly discredited by the war, the vacuum of legitimacy would be filled by powerful demagogues and populist dictatorships: “The best lack all conviction, while the worst/are full of passionate intensity.” Oswald Spengler had the same idea in his Decline of the West, published in 1918.Yeats’s political prognosis was shaped by his religious eschatology. He believed the world had to wade through “nightmare” for “Bethlehem to be born.” In his day, he was right. The nightmare he discerned continued through the Great Depression of 1929-1932, and culminated in World War II. These were preludes to the “second coming,” not of Christ, but of a liberalism built on firmer social foundations.But were the nightmares of depression and war necessary preludes? Is horror the price we must pay for progress? Evil has indeed often been the agent of good (without Hitler, no United Nations, no Pax Americana, no European Union, no taboo on racism, no decolonization, no Keynesian economics, and much else). But it does not follow that evil is necessary for good, much less that we should wish it as a means to an end. We cannot embrace the politics of upheaval, because we cannot be sure that it will produce a Roosevelt rather than a Hitler. Any decent, rational person hopes for a milder method to achieve progress.But must the milder method – call it parliamentary or constitutional democracy – break down periodically in disastrous fashion? The usual explanation is that a system fails because the elites lose touch with the masses. But while one would expect this disconnect to happen in dictatorships, why does disenchantment with democracy take root in democracies themselves?One explanation, which goes back to Aristotle, is the perversion of democracy by plutocracy. The more unequal a society, the more the lifestyles and values of the wealthy diverge from those of “ordinary” people. They come to inhabit symbolically gated communities in which only one type of public conversation is deemed decent, respectable, and acceptable. This itself represents a considerable disenfranchisement. To Trump’s supporters, his gaffes were not gaffes at all, or if they were, his supporters didn’t mind.But it is economics, not culture, that strikes at the heart of legitimacy. It is when the rewards of economic progress accrue mainly to the already wealthy that the disjunction between minority and majority cultural values becomes seriously destabilizing. And this, I think, is what is happening in the democratic world.The second coming of liberalism represented by Roosevelt, Keynes, and the founders of the European Union has been destroyed by the economics of globalization: the pursuit of an ideal equilibrium through the free movement of goods, capital, and labor, with its conjoined tolerance of financial criminality, obscenely lavish rewards for a few, high levels of unemployment and underemployment, and curtailment of the state’s role in welfare provision. The resulting inequality of economic outcomes strips away the democratic veil that hides from the majority of citizens the true workings of power. The “passionate intensity” of the populists conveys a simple, easily grasped, and now resonant message: the elites are selfish, corrupt, and often criminal. Power must be returned to the people. It is surely no coincidence that the two biggest political shocks of the year – Brexit and the election of Trump – have come in the two countries that most fervently embraced neoliberal economics.Trump’s geopolitical and economic views should be judged against this background of disenchantment, not by an ideal moral or economic standard. In other words, Trumpism could be a solution to the crisis of liberalism, not a portent of its disintegration.Viewed this way, Trump’s isolationism is a populist way of saying that the US needs to withdraw from commitments which it has neither the power nor the will to honor. The promise to work with Russia to end the savage conflict in Syria is sensible, even though it implies the victory of Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Disengaging peacefully from exposed global responsibilities will be Trump’s biggest challenge.Trump’s protectionism harks back to an older American tradition. The US economy of high-wage, job-rich manufacturing has foundered with globalization. But what would a feasible form of protectionism look like? The challenge will be to achieve stricter controls without beggaring the world economy or inflaming national rivalries and racist sentiment.\n\nTrump has also promised an $800 billion-$1 trillion program of infrastructure investment, to be financed by bonds, as well as a massive corporate-tax cut, both aimed at creating 25 million new jobs and boosting growth. This, together with a pledge to maintain welfare entitlements, amounts to a modern form of Keynesian fiscal policy (though of course not identified as such). Its merit is its head-on challenge to the neoliberal obsession with deficits and debt reduction, and to reliance on quantitative easing as the sole – and now exhausted – demand-management tool.As Trump moves from populism to policy, liberals should not turn away in disgust and despair, but rather engage with Trumpism’s positive potential. His proposals need to be interrogated and refined, not dismissed as ignorant ravings. The task of liberals is to ensure that a third coming of liberalism arrives with the least cost to liberal values. And there will be some cost. That is the meaning of Brexit, Trump’s victory, and any populist victories to come.","description":"As Trump moves from populism to policy, liberals should not turn away in disgust and despair, but rather engage with Trumpism’s positive potential.

Now, President-elect Donald Trump must decide whether he wants to plow forward with his divisive agenda or actually advance America’s best interests.\n\nThere are strong parallels between Trump’s victory and the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union last June. Republicans interviewed after the election result was known looked almost as shocked as the architects of the UK’s “Leave” campaign on the morning after the referendum. But no one was more dumbfounded than those on the losing side, which in both cases had been widely expected to come out on top.\n\nOne effect of the Brexit vote that has already emerged in the US as well is a surge in hate crimes, including an alarming number of incidents being reported at schools and on college campuses. Trump’s win has emboldened some of his supporters to move from the anonymity of abusing targets on social media to accosting them openly on the street.\n\nThis is not surprising: Trump’s campaign was marked by nearly 18 months of vitriol, aimed not just against his opponent, but also at US government institutions, the press, and many segments of the US population, particularly immigrants, refugees, supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, and Muslims. He attracted the endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan and surrounded his campaign with the white nationalists of the so-called alt-right.\n\nIn fact, many of the promises Trump made to his supporters during the campaign are highly divisive and even dangerous, and their implementation could have serious adverse effects on the lives of ordinary Americans, triggering civil unrest. Conversely, abandoning some of the policies he promised could trigger a backlash – perhaps violent – among his supporters.\n\nHowever busy Trump is planning the transition to the White House – selecting his cabinet and prioritizing his many promises – he must not ignore this risk. If he hopes to be anything remotely close to a responsible leader, he must move urgently to address the deep divisions that he so enthusiastically fueled during his campaign.\n\nThat means becoming more presidential, by advocating a calm and reasonable approach that emphasizes, above all, upholding the US Constitution and the rule of law. He should start by speaking out firmly against violence, and taking proactive measures to protect immigrants and minorities, who are understandably fearful of attacks by his supporters.\n\nMore broadly, Trump must avoid triumphalism, and acknowledge, with uncharacteristic humility, the magnitude of the challenge ahead. And he must convey a credible message about a consensual approach, discarding the partisan hostility that has dominated US politics in recent years and, in particular, during the just-concluded campaign.\n\nOf course, Trump is not in this alone, and a leader is only as good as his or her team. To build credibility, Trump will need to be transparent about how he crafts his administration, ensuring that it includes the knowledge and experience that he lacks. He does not have a deep bench to draw from, but he must find a way to make it work, assembling a group that can advise him wisely.\n\nIt is vital that Trump takes these steps quickly, so that his administration can hit the ground running. Only then can he hope not only to meet his commitments for the first 100 days in office, but also – and more important – to begin easing the fear and anger that his campaign has brought to fever pitch.\n\nAll legislators – whether pro- or anti-Trump, Republican or Democrat – must participate fully in the effort to reduce tensions, improve cooperation, and protect the US political system’s checks and balances. They must recognize that the US today is a tinderbox. The time for playing with fire is over. Cool heads must prevail.\n\nThe business, culture, and non-profit sectors, as well as the press and pundits, must remain calm as well, resisting the lure of hyperbole and scare tactics, and look toward a shared future. Most important, community leaders must not allow their constituents to be manipulated or goaded into behavior that risks dangerous knock-on effects.\n\nJudging by Trump’s long history as a public figure, the idea that he would help to bridge the divides in the US probably seems ludicrous. His victory speech did include the traditional pledge to be “president for all Americans.” The American people need to hold him to that sentiment – and uphold it themselves. Some – indeed many – will never support him; but it is his job, as president, to reach out to all and appeal to the country’s shared values.\n\nBeing president and running for president require very different skills. President-elect Trump must use his first 100 days in office not just to make appointments and prioritize legislation, but also to set a reassuring tone for his administration. Stability and trust must be the order of the day.\n\nIn his second inaugural address, following a period of extreme division and civil war, Abraham Lincoln declared, “let us strive on” and “bind up the nation’s wounds.” Trump is no Lincoln, but he did invoke the same spirit in his victory speech. One hopes that he meant it.","description":"On the 27th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the US elected a president who plans to build an even bigger wall, this time on the border with Mexico.

It is a development that will be difficult – perhaps even impossible – to reverse, especially for Trump.Traditionally, countries’ global political power was assessed according to military might: the one with the largest army had the most power. But that logic was not always reflected in reality. The US lost the Vietnam War; the Soviet Union was defeated in Afghanistan. In its first few years in Iraq, the US discovered the wisdom of Talleyrand’s adage that the one thing you cannot do with a bayonet is sit on it.Enter soft power. The term was coined by Harvard’s Joseph S. Nye in 1990 to account for the influence a country – and, in particular, the US – wields, beyond its military (or “hard”) power. As Nye put it, a country’s power rests on its “ability to alter the behavior of others” to get what it wants, whether through coercion (sticks), payments (carrots), or attraction (soft power). “If you are able to attract others,” he pointed out, “you can economize on the sticks and carrots.”Nye argues that a country’s soft power arises from “its culture (in places where it is attractive to others), its political values (when it lives up to them at home and abroad), and its foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate and having moral authority.)” But I believe that it also emerges from the world’s perceptions of what a country is about: the associations and attitudes conjured by the mention of a country’s name. Hard power is exercised; soft power is evoked.The US has been the world’s largest economy and oldest democracy, a haven for immigrants, and the land of the American Dream – the promise that anyone can be anything if they work hard enough. It is also the home of Boeing and Intel, Google and Apple, Microsoft and MTV, Hollywood and Disneyland, McDonald’s and Starbucks – in short, some of the most recognizable and influential brands and industries in the world.The attractiveness of these assets, and of the American lifestyle that they represent, is that they enable the US to persuade, rather than compel, others to adopt its agenda. In this sense, soft power acts as both an alternative and a complement to hard power.But there are limits to a country’s soft power – even America’s. In the wake of the US terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was an outpouring of goodwill for the US. Then the country launched its War on Terror, in which it relied heavily on hard power. The instruments of that power – the Iraq invasion, indefinite detention of “enemy combatants” and other suspects at Guantánamo Bay prison, the Abu Ghraib scandal, revelations of CIA “black sites,” the killing of Iraqi civilians by private US security contractors – were not received well by the global public.America’s soft-power assets were inadequate to compensate for the deficiencies of its hard-power approach. Fans of American culture were not prepared to overlook the excesses of Guantánamo. Using Microsoft Windows does not predispose you to accept torture by the country that produces it. America’s soft power declined sharply, demonstrating that how a country exercises its hard power affects how much soft power it can evoke.America’s domestic narrative soon overcame its foreign-policy setbacks, thanks partly to today’s unprecedented connectivity. In a world of instant mass communications, countries are judged by a global public fed on a diet of relentless online news, smartphone videos, and Twitter gossip. In such an information age, Nye wrote, three types of countries are likely to gain soft power: “those whose dominant cultures and ideals are closer to prevailing global norms (which now emphasize liberalism, pluralism, autonomy); those with the most access to multiple channels of communication and thus more influence over how issues are framed; and those whose credibility is enhanced by their domestic and international performance.” The US had done pretty well on all of these fronts. Indeed, America’s culture and ideals set the bar for others, and its international credibility rested on its domestic arrangements. Overcoming the legacy of centuries of slavery and racism to elect a black president in 2008 and again in 2012 seemed to embody the country’s capacity to reinvent and renew itself.Trump’s ascent to power has shattered that image. It has exposed and encouraged tendencies the world never used to associate with the US: xenophobia, misogyny, pessimism, and selfishness. A system that promised a level playing field on which anyone could fulfill their aspirations is being denounced by its own political leaders as stacked against ordinary citizens. A country that confidently counsels others on democratic practice has elected a president who suggested that, if he lost, he might not recognize the result.\n\nNye has argued that, in an information age, soft power often accrues to the country with the better story. The US has long been the “land of the better story.” It has a free press and an open society; it welcomes migrants and refugees; it has a thirst for new ideas and a knack for innovation. All of this has given the US an extraordinary ability to tell stories that are more persuasive and attractive than those of its rivals.But the story of America told in this election has deeply diminished the soft power the US evokes. Fear trumped hope. The American Dream became the world’s nightmare. And the demons released from Pandora’s box in 2016 – echoing in widespread reports of racist taunts by Trump supporters of non-whites in America – will continue to roam free in the country’s self-perception, and taint everyone else’s perception, too. In our eyes, America will never be the same – and Trump’s term hasn’t even begun.","description":"One major casualty of Donald Trump’s victory in the bruising US presidential election is, without a doubt, America’s soft power around the world. It is a development that will be difficult – perhaps even impossible – to reverse, especially for Trump.","keywords":"shashi tharoor,trump,us,soft power,military,president","time":1478880009,"url":"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-presidential-election-soft-power-by-shashi-tharoor-2016-11"},{"title":"The Trump Shock in Latin America","body":"MEXICO CITY – Despite US President-elect Donald Trump’s crude behavior, insulting rhetoric, and vicious incitement over the past year and a half, the mantra in the coming days will inevitably be that it is time to move forward. His opponent, Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama have already wished him a successful presidency.\n\nOutside the US, the focus will be on damage control, to protect US-European relations, NATO, and ongoing diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. But there is one world region that cannot possibly adopt a forward-looking attitude: Latin America.\n\nFor starters, since the start of his campaign, Trump has dismissed Mexico’s national interests and maligned its people’s character. He has repeatedly promised to deport all six million undocumented Mexicans living and working in the US, and to force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall on the US-Mexican border. And he has said that he will renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and discourage US companies from investing or creating jobs in Mexico.\n\nIt is rare to see an advanced democracy elect a leader who is so openly hostile to a neighboring country. And while Trump has not singled out any other Latin American countries in this way, his proposals would nevertheless affect many of them, if not all. Every Central American country is a source of migration to the US, as are many Caribbean and South American countries. Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru all have large populations of documented or undocumented nationals in the US, and they will all feel the effects of Trump’s policies, if they are enacted.\n\nWhat’s more, countries such as Chile, which negotiated the TPP in good faith with the US, Mexico, Peru, and Asian-Pacific countries, will now suffer the consequences of Trump’s protectionist stance. So will the ten-odd Latin American countries that have concluded bilateral free-trade agreements (FTAs) with the US over the past 20 years.\n\nIn short, Trump’s election is an unmitigated disaster for the region. But many Latin American countries may optimistically assume that he meant none of what he said for 18 months, that his policy proposals were nothing more than campaign rhetoric, and that he will be unable to implement most of his agenda in any case.\n\nWishful thinkers will argue that members of the Republican-led US Senate and House of Representatives are not nearly as protectionist as Trump, and would never agree to roll back existing FTAs. Some might even believe that congressional Republicans will pressure Trump to embrace the TPP (or that Obama will push it through Congress before he leaves office in two months).\n\nSimilarly, some political observers in the US and Latin America may argue that Trump cannot possibly implement any of his harebrained immigration-policy proposals. The material and logistical challenges of actually rounding up millions of people and building a wall are simply too daunting.\n\nUnfortunately, these expectations are naive. Obama had no trouble deporting more than two million Mexicans and Central Americans during his eight years in office; and there is already a partition along more than 700 miles of the 1,951-mile-long US-Mexico border. It is not hard to imagine Trump beating Obama’s deportation record and expanding the border partition by as many miles as his predecessors have since 1993, when construction began under US President Bill Clinton.\n\nLikewise, we have every reason to expect that Trump’s presidency will be bad for trade. Trump owes his victory to voters in states that were negatively affected by NAFTA (and by China’s accession in 2001 to the World Trade Organization), such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. What will all of the voters in these states say if Trump suddenly starts ratifying new FTAs?\n\nJournalists, academics, businesspeople, diplomats, and others worldwide are now struggling to determine what Trump’s presidency will mean for the future of international affairs. But one thing seems certain: the international order that emerged after the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1989 will change; business as usual will not continue.\n\nNo region will suffer more under Trump’s presidency than the Western Hemisphere. For Americans and Latin Americans alike, the election of Trump has marked the start of a difficult road.","description":"Latin American countries should disabuse themselves of the hope that Donald Trump did not mean what he said during his campaign, that his policy proposals were mere rhetoric, and that he can't possibly implement most of his agenda in any case.

If only, so the received wisdom goes, economies could get back to a more “normal” rate of GDP and productivity growth, life would improve for more people, anti-establishment sentiment would wane, and politics would return to “normal” as well. Then, capitalism, globalization, and democracy could continue their forward march.But such thinking reflects an extrapolation from one largely aberrant period in history. That period is over, and the forces that sustained it are unlikely to align again anytime soon. Technological innovation and demographics are now a headwind, not a tailwind, for growth, and financial engineering can’t save the day.The aberrant period in history is the hundred or so years after the US Civil War, during which breakthroughs in energy, electrification, telecommunications, and transportation fundamentally reshaped societies. Human lives became markedly more productive, and life expectancies rose dramatically. The global population grew over 50% between 1800 and 1900, and then more than doubled over the following 50 years, with economies growing much faster than in previous centuries.By the end of the 1970s, growth began to slow in many of the developed Western economies, and US President Ronald Reagan and Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan ushered in a debt cycle that supercharged activity. The US, until then a net creditor to the world, became a net borrower, with China and other emerging markets benefiting from America’s rising trade deficit. Financial leverage drove global growth onward for almost another 30 years.The 2008 global crisis brought an abrupt end to the era of financial engineering. But policymakers don’t like to see growth slow, and central bankers exhausted their toolkits in an attempt to stimulate economic activity despite insufficient demand. With less and less yield to be found in traditional fixed-income assets, investors piled into risk assets of all forms, driving up their price; the rich got richer, and the middle class was left further behind. As growth in the real economy continued to stagnate, angry populism surged, resulting in Brexit and President-elect Trump.For all that central bankers have done to revive economic growth, the forces of demographics and innovation have worked against them. Advanced economies’ aging populations are drawing more and more on social safety nets. China is also aging. Most of today’s (and tomorrow’s) demographic growth is in Africa, where it doesn’t drive global productivity to the extent that it does elsewhere.Furthermore, the current wave of technological innovation is not lifting all boats. Even as the likes of Uber and Amazon, and, more fundamentally, robotics, add convenience, they do so by displacing working-class jobs and/or driving down wages.This is typical of the process of “creative destruction” that Joseph Schumpeter famously described as being the handmaiden of growth in capitalist economies. The first wave of a breakthrough innovation chiefly benefits a few entrepreneurs. Then comes a wave of displacement, as the technology is adapted to existing industries. Three decades ago, it was Wal-Mart using computers and logistics to wipe out small “mom and pop” stores; today, it is Amazon taking on Wal-Mart.The third wave is the widespread diffusion of the innovation in ways that lift overall productivity and living standards. This takes much longer. Or, as the Nobel laureate economist Robert Solow observed in 1987, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”Northwestern University’s Robert Gordon has argued that the economic impact of today’s innovations doesn’t hold a candle to that of plumbing or electricity. Perhaps, or it may be that we are at an early stage of the Schumpeterian cycle of innovation (enriching a few) and destruction (creating anxiety in vulnerable sectors). Eventually, average productivity and real incomes are likely to benefit as breakthrough technologies enable new kinds of growth.The problem is that it may take a decade or longer before robotics and the like feed a broader rising tide that lifts all boats. And whether Schumpeter or Gordon is right is irrelevant for politicians facing angry voters whose standard of living has declined. Today, their fed-up constituents reject globalization; tomorrow, they may become Luddites.The question now is whether a shift in focus from unconventional monetary policies to Keynesian demand management can save the day. It is widely assumed that monetary policy is a spent force in the US and Europe, and that fiscal stimulus and expansion – for example, via tax cuts and infrastructure spending – must take over. But this requires stable political systems that can sustain long-term fiscal strategies. Recent developments, particularly in Europe, suggest that such strategies will be difficult to implement.In the US, Trump’s victory, coupled with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress, paves the way for tax cuts and increased defense spending. The pump looks set to be primed. But fiscal expansion is likely to meet resistance from monetary policy, as the Fed resumes its “normalization” of interest rates.\n\nStill, the hope is that faster US growth and rising wages will quell voters’ populist rebellion. The onus, ironically, will remain on the Fed to “do the right thing” – namely, to normalize interest rates with extreme caution, while allowing the share of labor income in GDP to rise, even if that requires some overshooting of inflation.To paraphrase Dylan Thomas, we believers in markets should not go gently into the populist night. We should fight against the dying of the light of global capitalism with every tool we can muster. Today’s slowing growth and political backlash is not some “new normal.” Rather, it harks back to an “old normal,” last experienced in the 1930s. Whatever the right way forward for the global economy, we know that it cannot mean a return to the isolationism and protectionism of that era.","description":"The politics of economic anxiety has now driven the electorates of the UK and the US into the hands of populists, and more countries' voters are sure to follow.

Japanese and U.S. officials said on Wednesday the State Department had not been involved in planning the meeting, leaving the logistical and protocol details that normally would be settled far in advance still to be determined.“There has been a lot of confusion,” said one Japanese official. The meeting was only agreed to last week and Trump and his advisers have been busy in meetings at his headquarters in Manhattan's Trump Tower in recent days to work out who gets which job in the new administration. While world leaders sometimes hold loosely planned bilateral meetings at regional summits, it is unusual for foreign leaders to hold high-level diplomatic talks in the United States without detailed planning. Abe is on his way to an Asia-Pacific summit in Peru.State Department spokesman John Kirby said that to his knowledge, Trump's transition team had not been in contact with the department either to discuss the transition of government or to seek information ahead of his meetings with foreign leaders.Trump is expected to use the Abe meeting to reassure Japan and other Asian allies rattled by his campaign rhetoric, advisers to Trump said. But Trump, a brash outsider with no diplomatic or government experience, and Abe, a veteran lawmaker, have differences on policy issues such as free trade. Several Trump aides did not immediately answer requests on Wednesday for comment about the Abe visit or contact between the transition team and the State Department. Speculation about top appointments to the Trump administration has intensified since the head of the team overseeing the transition, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, was removed last week and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence.Transition team officials said on Wednesday night that Trump planned to announce \"landing teams\" on Thursday that would begin setting up staff in key agencies, like the State and Justice departments.\n\nThey added in a conference call with reporters that those who begin working on the teams would have to sign an agreement not to lobby for five years after they leave the administration, keeping with a Trump campaign promise to institute a ban on lobbying for executive branch employees. Trump on Wednesday denounced reports of disorganization in the team, singling out the New York Times for saying world leaders have had trouble getting in touch with him since his upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Nov. 8 presidential election. The Republican real estate magnate said on Twitter he had taken \"calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan.\" The Times, a frequent target of Trump's Twitter blasts, said on Tuesday that U.S. allies were \"scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Mr. Trump\" and blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach him.The newspaper said Trump was working without official State Department briefing materials in his dealings with foreign leaders. \"The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition,\" Trump tweeted, without specifying what it was in the article that was incorrect. \"It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.\" Trump and Pence had spoken to 29 foreign leaders, the transition team said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has mostly stuck to normal practice for a U.S. president-elect with the order in which he has spoken to foreign leaders on the phone since his election victory.But some of his contacts have stretched the limits of the usual procedure. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, an army general who seized power three years ago, appears to have been the first leader to speak to Trump after the election, ahead of closer allies like the leaders of Britain and Germany.Sisi's office called Trump last Wednesday and the incoming U.S. president told him it was \"the first international call he had received to congratulate him on winning the election.\" Australian media reported that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was the second leader Trump spoke to, after the Australian ambassador to the United States got Trump's personal phone number from Australian golfer and Trump friend Greg Norman. Trump also talked on the phone to the leaders of Britain, Germany, Turkey and other allies. But a phone call on Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in which the two men agreed to aim for \"constructive cooperation,\" raised eyebrows among Democrats and traditionalist Republicans worried about a resurgent Moscow.\n\nTrump also met Britain's anti-EU Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage at Trump Tower last weekend, ahead of any meeting with British Prime Minister Theresa May.State Department spokesman Kirby said: \"There’s been no outreach to date\" from Trump's transition aides. \"But it's not for us to approve or disapprove of conversations that the president-elect is having or may have in the future with foreign leaders.\"Despite fevered speculation, Trump has yet to say who will fill Cabinet positions such as secretary of state, treasury secretary or defense secretary. His team said that was not unusual and was in line with the timing of the transition of Democrat Barack Obama to the White House after he won the presidency in 2008. Trump could add son-in-law Jared Kushner as a top White House adviser, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, has been a central adviser during the campaign and transition. The Trump transition team has repeatedly denied it is seeking high-level security clearance for Kushner.A federal anti-nepotism law prohibits a president from hiring family members to serve in his administration, but the Journal said it was not clear if the law applied to a position inside the White House. It added Kushner had indicated he would avoid the issue by not taking pay for any White House work. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump aide who served as his campaign manager, said she did not think Kushner was seeking an official role in the White House.\"I just hung up the phone with Jared, and we didn't discuss that,\" Conway told reporters on Wednesday night. \"I think he just wants to be incredibly helpful to his father-in-law as he's been all along.\"South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley will meet with Trump on Thursday, the transition team said. She emerged on Wednesday as a potential candidate for secretary of state.After speculation emerged that JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon remained a contender for treasury secretary, the bank's stock price dropped.

Common goals call for a close partnership.\" Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone on Monday and Xi told the U.S. President-elect cooperation was the only choice for the world's two largest economies, while Trump said they had established a \"clear sense of mutual respect.\"Nevertheless, Trump's election has created uncertainty when Beijing hopes for stability as it faces daunting reform challenges at home, slowing growth and a leadership reshuffle that will assemble a new party elite around Xi in late 2017. Zbigniew Brzezinski, who as U.S. National Security Adviser drove normalization with China in the late 1970s told the same Washington event the world was watching U.S. political developments \"with some stupefaction.\"\n\n\"We are now living in a political system, a worldwide system, that is experiencing a very serious crisis... .

But it will be a long time before they can move back for good.Homes have been flattened by bombardment, shopfronts and garages gutted, burnt and looted, and black patches from mortar explosions scorch the ground along the main road.Bashiqa's residents fled in different directions and at different speeds when the militants took over in 2014 after sweeping into Iraq from Syria.\"We left immediately,\" said Bakarat, a Yazidi like most people from the town.Islamic State has killed Muslims and non-Muslims alike, but has been particularly brutal with the Yazidi minority, whose beliefs combine elements of several religions. Thousands have been killed, captured and enslaved by the group in what the United Nations says is genocide.Bakarat said some Muslim inhabitants had stayed on for a while, but Christians and Yazidis knew exactly what their fate would be if they did not get out straight away. Those who were better off rented homes in other towns, and those without the means went to camps.\n\nBakarat and his family still live in the northern city of Duhok. With most of Bashiqa destroyed and no services or supplies, they expect it will be a long exile.\"We can begin to clean up this mess, but there's no point returning to live until there's electricity, water, and most importantly full security,\" he said on his first trip back, declining to give his full name in a sign of lingering concern.A U.S.-backed offensive to drive Islamic State out of Mosul, its last major stronghold in Iraq, has recaptured many towns and villages around the city since it began in earnest last month. The operation involves some 100,000 government troops, Kurdish security forces and Shi'ite militiamen.\n\nRaghid Rashid, a local Yazidi policeman, returned this month and fought alongside the peshmerga to recapture the town, 7 miles northeast of Mosul.\"The fight to get Bashiqa back was tough. Daesh (Islamic State) used suicide bombers, tunnels, snipers. When we got here half the town was destroyed - including my home,\" he said, adding that Yazidi shrines had also been desecrated.On the steel shutters of several local businesses, the words \"Sunni Muslim\" have been scrawled by Islamic State militants, to distinguish the owners from locals of other faiths, or from those they consider apostates - both punishable by death under their rule.Rashid, Bakarat and other men had come to listen to an address by Masoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq.\n\nNominally under the jurisdiction of Baghdad, the area is controlled by the KRG and Barzani spoke only Kurdish.Speaking from a podium and flanked by Kurdish flags and banners proclaiming religious and ethnic coexistence, he said the peshmerga, the KRG's armed forces, would not withdraw from areas they had seized from IS, and vowed to protect minorities living in areas under Kurdish control.Kurdish fighters were recently accused by a human rights group of unlawfully destroying Arab homes in areas they captured from Islamic State between 2014 and May 2016, a charge the KRG denies.It was not possible to stray too far from the main road to visit abandoned homes because the area was not yet fully cleared of IEDs and booby traps.As Barzani spoke, two distant but large explosions were heard, apparently from the ongoing fight inside Mosul.\"Daesh is gone. But even if they came back I'd stay put, and I'd fight to the death if necessary,\" Rashid said, dressed in combat fatigues and a black cap. \"We know their tactics now and we're not scared anymore.\" (Editing by Philippa Fletcher)","description":"For the first time since Islamic State militants swept into Bashiqa two years ago forcing him to flee, 61-year-old Barakat has finally found work - on Sunday he will coming back to help clear debris from the destruction wrought upon his home town.","keywords":"Iraq,Syria,Bakarat,Masoud Barzani,Raghid Rashid,US,MIDEAST,CRISIS,IRAQ,KURDS,YAZIDI,Crime / Law / Justice,Christianity,Islam,Military Conflicts,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Crime,France,Major News,Middle East,Pictures,Conflicts / War / Peace,United States,Asylum / Immigration / Refugees,Iraq,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Metals and Mining (TRBC),Europe,Race Relations / Ethnic Issues,United Nations,International / National Security,Civil Unrest,Insurgencies","time":1479362893,"url":"http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/MQ3Zdo1P0uw/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds-yazidi-idUSKBN13C0GC"},{"title":"Top U.S. diplomat role an unlikely fit for 'tough guy' Giuliani","body":"NEW YORK Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is now the leading candidate to become President-elect Donald Trump's secretary of state, but even some Republicans say his tough-guy personality and global business ties may be at odds with international diplomacy.Giuliani, 72, has been one of Trump's most vocal and high-profile supporters, and according to sources close to him and Trump, he is eager to become the top U.S. diplomat and expects a decision by Trump as early as next week. The other top candidate, the sources said, is former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, a foreign policy hawk.New York mayor at the time of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks by al Qaeda militants, Giuliani is also considered a hard-liner on national security matters, but he has little diplomatic experience.Still, some prominent Republicans said he is qualified to take command of U.S. diplomacy at a time of chaos in the Middle East, rising nationalism in much of Europe, and growing challenges from Russia and China.Senator Lindsey Graham, a respected conservative voice on defense and foreign policy who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee and who made a rather short-lived bid for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, on Tuesday called Giuliani \"competent and capable\" of being secretary of state. \"Rudy is an internationally-known figure. He's a personal friend. He has dealt with the unimaginable, which was 9/11. He's a loyal supporter of President Trump. He should be rewarded in my view,\" Graham told reporters.Giuliani himself extolled his foreign policy credentials in an interview with Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity on Tuesday. \"I've been in 80 countries, 150 different foreign trips,\" Giuliani said. \"A lot of it for different reasons. Speeches. Security consulting, where I helped bring down crime.\"\n\nCritics, however, said they are troubled not only by Giuliani's combative nature and lack of experience, but also by his international business ties and his lucrative speaking engagements for an Iranian exile group that was on the U.S. terrorism list until four years ago.The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its consideration of Giuliani for secretary of state.After serving as New York mayor for eight years, Giuliani founded management and security consulting firm Giuliani Partners in 2002, which he left in 2007 when he campaigned for the Republican presidential nomination and questions were raised about his foreign business ties.\n\nThe firm's clients have included Colombia and, reportedly, the government of Qatar. Giuliani appears to have resumed work with the firm after his 2007 failed presidential bid, and is listed as chairman and chief executive officer of Giuliani Partners on the Giuliani Security and Safety website.He joined a Texas law firm as a name partner in 2005. The firm did lobbying work for Citgo, a U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, which at the time was controlled by President Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's late socialist ruler. At the time, Giuliani's office said he was not personally involved in the lobbying and said Giuliani believed that \"Chavez is not a friend of the United States.\"Giuliani's dealings in Russia may face scrutiny in Senate confirmation hearings. His ties to TriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a consulting firm that helps Western clients advance their business interests in emerging markets of the former Soviet Union, date back to 2004, when Giuliani visited Moscow to meet Russian businessmen and politicians, according to the company's website.The consulting firm's president, Vitaly Pruss, has \"created and developed strategies\" for companies including Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and has \"worked closely\" with Giuliani Partners, according to his profile on TriGlobal's website. State-owned Transneft was among Russian oil companies targeted with sanctions by Western powers following Russia's annexation of Crimea under President Vladimir Putin.\n\nGiuliani also has spoken in support of the People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group of Islamic leftists who opposed Iran's late shah, but fell out with the Shi'ite clerics who took power after the 1979 revolution and later aligned itself with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The U.S. government considered it a terrorist organization until 2012.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who also was a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, told CNN on Tuesday he was worried about Giuliani's ties to foreign governments.    \"Whether or not you have divided loyalties obviously is very important,\" Paul said. \"I hope Donald Trump will pick somebody consistent with what he said on the campaign trail - Iraq war was a mistake, regime change in the Middle East is a mistake.\"You want to have a diplomat in charge of diplomacy,\" he said.Critics, however, say the bottom line is that Giuliani is no diplomat, either personally or professionally. \"The challenge for Giuliani if he becomes secretary of state would be to move beyond the tough guy persona he cultivated as prosecutor and mayor and instead stand up for some of the basic principles of human rights, democratic accountability, and the rule of law that enhance rather than shrink America's influence abroad,\" said Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who worked for Giuliani when he was a federal prosecutor between 1983 and 1987.

He urged creditors to help Greece dig out of its mountain of debt and called on young people to stay in the country to spur its economic recovery.But his broader message extended beyond Athens. Step-by-step, Obama listed the values of U.S. democracy that he and fellow Democrats in the United States have accused Trump of violating during his presidential campaign, an implicit call on his successor to change course.\n\nIn the same way that democracies are based on the peaceful resolution of disagreements within society, so cooperation is the best way to resolve conflicts with nations, he said.\"That's how with diplomacy we were able to shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot (and) with diplomacy the United States opened relations with Cuba,\" Obama said, referring to two important milestones of his presidency.He noted how U.S. democracy had evolved to provide rights to women, African Americans, people with disabilities, and the gay community.Trump has been criticized for his attitudes toward women and for making fun of a disabled reporter. He has pledged to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States and to deport undocumented immigrants who are living in the country illegally.\n\nDemocracy is why the United States welcomes \"people of all races, and all religions and all backgrounds and immigrants who strive to give their children a better life,\" Obama said.\"Our democracies show that we are stronger than terrorists, fundamentalists and absolutists, who can't tolerate difference. \"Democracy is stronger than organizations like ISIS,\" he said, using one of the names for Islamic State.\n\n\"Because our democracies are inclusive, we are able to welcome people, and refugees in need, to our countries. And nowhere have we seen that compassion more evident than here in Greece,\" he said, referring to the Greek response to Europe's migrant crisis.Obama highlighted the importance of a free press to expose injustice. Trump banned certain news outlets from his campaign events for writing stories he did not like. The Obama administration has been criticized for its record on press freedom as well, particularly for prosecuting government sources who leak information to journalists. In his speech, Obama highlighted the importance of an independent judiciary to uphold the rule of law. During his campaign, Trump accused a U.S. judge of not being able to be impartial because of his Mexican heritage.Obama also noted that elections hold leaders accountable.\"Any action by a president or any result of an election or any legislation that is proven flawed can be corrected through the process of democracy,\" he said.

Further helicopter evacuations from Kaikoura on Thursday had been disrupted due to the bad weather, said Sarah Stuart-Black, director of the Ministry of Civil Defence Emergency Management.\"We are really concerned about the changing weather situation,\" she told reporters. \"It could mean that there's an increased risk of further landslides, obviously surface flooding, so we want people to be safe.\"An inland road to Kaikoura, briefly reopened to emergency vehicles, was closed due to more landslides, officials said. Warships from Australia, Canada and the United States, in the country for the Royal New Zealand Navy’s 75th anniversary, had arrived in Kaikoura to assist with the recovery.“The ships, crews and maritime helicopters provided by our partner militaries have given us a great deal of flexibility in supporting the national relief effort,” said New Zealand Joint Forces Commander Major General Tim Gall.Most of the tourists evacuated to Christchurch, the South Island's largest city about 150 km (90 miles) south of Kaikoura, had continued their journeys but around 130 people were being housed temporarily in Canterbury University's student halls.With damage expected to take months to repair, the government announced a NZ$7.5 million ($5.3 million) wage subsidy package to support small businesses in Kaikoura for two months.\n\n\"These companies ... are going to have a sustained reduction in their turnover to the point of almost nothing for a long period of time and that's why we think it's appropriate for the government to step in,\" Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce told reporters. Analysts at ANZ Bank said that, while the local economic hit would be significant, there would only be a \"small dent\" in New Zealand's overall activity, far lower than the 2011 quake in Christchurch that killed almost 200 people.In Wellington, as many as 60 buildings were damaged, including serious structural damage to three relatively recently constructed multi-storey buildings, one of which engineers said would have to be torn down.\n\nThe government said it would launch an investigation into why the newer buildings had been unable to withstand the quake.More buildings were evacuated and roads cordoned off on Thursday as engineers assessed the damage.Wellington is bisected by several fault lines, and large areas of its business district are built on reclaimed land, raising questions about building practices in the capital despite some of the world's strictest codes.\"It is a concern, people do want to know the buildings they're in are going to be safe,\" Wellington Mayor Justin Lester told reporters. \"Everybody wants a building to perform as is expected, so when it doesn't ... you need to understand how. There's no simple answer.\"The force of the tremor was most evident in the upper South Island, where parts of the coast moved meters. A team of volunteers rescued thousands of abalone, a large shellfish known locally as paua, that had been thrown up from the sea bed and left high and dry.\n\nA popular New Zealand fur seal colony near Kaikoura, where pups could often be seeing playing in a waterfall in a nearby stream, was destroyed by a landslide, Department of Conversation officials said.Civil Defence evacuated some residents near several rivers in the region where landslides from the earthquakes had blocked the rivers and risked dangerous collapses.Seismologists are still recording hundreds of aftershocks - some 2,000 have rattled the region since the initial tremor.Government body Geonet Science estimated an almost one-in-three chance of another 7-7.8 magnitude quake hitting the wider region within the next 30 days.\"We stress to Wellington that we need to be prepared,\" Lester, the mayor, said.

Of course they are…they’re yielding like 20% and it’s an industry freeze. They’ll walk it back to ~10% yield, those of us who’ve been here from the start will be back to what we were making two or three years ago, and all three companies will be better off for it.\n\nNow things are getting out of hand. I cannot speak for SLCA or EMES, because I don’t own either. I never wanted to own either. But I do speak for HCLP when I say a great company is going for peanuts.\n\nNow, I am not adding to my position.

If I had been so fortunate to be outside this fire, looking in, then I would be nibbling incrementally, every couple of weeks. But that is not a luxury I personally get to enjoy.\n\nSo far for the year, I’m down about 15% – that’s about 40% peak to trough if I’m counting from when this process all started a little over 12 months ago. I guess if I’m looking big picture, I’m fortunate that’s all that’s happened. There are people out there who have lost 70% because of this oil catastrophe.\n\nFor the moment, I am more than content to sit on lots of cash and wait this thing out.

The shares are worth about $10.42 apiece by my estimation, and are currently going for $26. In the first six months of the year, we’ve seen a big increase in share value, even after issuing new shares, up from about $8.62 as of December 2014.\n\nThe companies operations are rewarding shareholders richly as of late. Net sales climbed 40% from the first six months of 2015 over the first six months of 2014. Basic income per share rose to $0.55, up from $0.40 period over period – 37.5% increase, matching the sales growth. Cash from operations is up 59.5%. It looks to me like this is real; not just a financial gimmick.\n\nI had purchased this company in part because I saw an off radar business with solid fundamentals. But I also guessed that TIS would have the opportunity to make a lot of above average returns in the near future, thanks to all the meltdowns in South America leading to scarcity of basic paper products.\n\nI still need to confirm where TIS is shipping product to, but even if that isn’t exactly what’s happened, I seem to be getting a pretty big payoff anyway. The company has a focus on US markets, but there is also some elusion to “Away From Home” sales, following the acquisition of Fabrica in Mexico. Regardless, TIS is growing at a 40% clip for the moment, and management seems eager to keep a fast tempo pace going.\n\nIt might be harder to materialize windfall gains than with a bigger company, since it’s unlikely institutional shareholders will come in and bid up the business.

HCLP is a company that is almost growing through this oil correction. BAS is collapsing, and that makes perfect sense.\n\nHere we note first that accounts receivables have been cut in half (unlike HCLP where they were actually growing). This is exactly what I should expect of a company which is in the business of drilling wells when oil falls like this.\n\nTotal current assets have dropped by 25% and now stand a full $100 million less than they were, in a span of 6 months.\n\nBAS is also taking this is an opportunity to write off anything they can on the books. That makes sense – might as well take advantage of the storm where you can.\n\nDebt for BAS is not unreasonable, and is one of the more attractive aspects of the company. Whereas many of their competitors are in real threat of default, I think BAS has repayment under control with a debt to equity ratio of 5.4.\n\nI’m putting the intrinsic value of BAS at about $4.00. The company trades around there today. There is no premium for these shares at this time, no risk threshold to overcome. That sort of makes sense, since the company is losing money on paper, and Wall Street has decided this entire sector is suspect. But that’s also a nice floor to be working up from.\n\nBAS lost $1.20 per share in the most recent three months reported, and a full $2.00 per share for the past six months on record. But here I view the most important element to be where those losses stand against amortization and depreciation.\n\nBAS has done a stellar job of idling operations and cutting staff apace of the revenue collapse. They have kept their real cost outflows below where the revenue line is at. If we look past the write down of equipment, the company has been cash neutral for the past six months – a remarkable effort on their part.\n\nNow, obviously equipment of an oilfield services company is under some sizable strain and must be replaced. But here, BAS has three factors working in their favor.\n\nFirstly, BAS is not using all of their equipment, because they have idled operations. Provided proper maintenance and storage, their current size operations can last twice as long as before they scaled down.\n\nSecondly, newer generations of equipment in this industry has reported longer lifespans and cheaper costs. I would imagine having so many now distressed oilfield services companies will also do wonders to get already built equipment from manufacturers to BAS at a yet more fabulous price. This was something I had been looking for before any of this happened to boost BAS profitability. It may not help save them.\n\nAnd Finally, BAS is not going to have to buy much equipment for the foreseeable future; the CEO has set down a strategy of acquiring or merging with weaker competitors and absorbing their existing equipment along with. They are specifically creating target lists based on how well these prospects have maintained their service equipment and the average age of it.\n\nSo although each double digit percentage down day roils my stomach, when I see what the company is doing I almost have no more fear.\n\nYou can see the expert management at play here in the cash flows section best. Although income has reversed from a negligible gain to an $81 million loss, the cash coming into the business is barely down at all ($88 million versus $94 million a year ago). Paper profits determines investor sentiment, but cash is going to determine who lives and dies.\n\nBAS is religiously guarding cash, keeping it flowing into the business…current tribulations not withstanding. After repaying debts (they aren’t even trying to raise more money right now) and other financing activities, BAS still saw cash increase by more than $10 million.\n\nBAS is a most extreme tale for me. Back in September of last year, I sat tight because I had a 75% profit margin to work with. Yet, I have somehow still lost 50% of my principle. I will be the first person to tell you, I did not see this coming.\n\nBut although my heart is scared and weak, my head says “stay put”.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1442413397,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/ezqNiN5X34A/"},{"title":"Mr. Cain Thaler","body":"One of the reasons – probably the biggest – that I haven’t reshuffled my portfolio since last year is, if I were outside the oil and gas sector when this blowup happened, I’d be buying everything in view right now.\n\nIt’s always pretty rough when it’s your carcass getting chewed on, but that realization is pretty important to my overall strategy right now.\n\nI’ve been keeping a close eye on the positions I’ve been keeping and their balance sheets.\n\nTake HCLP:\n\nNet cash from operations has actually increased to $58.0 million from $53.6 million. The increase has come from growth of accounts receivables, which sets up a discussion about what future business for HCLP might look like. The company is under hardship, yet they have more customer money on deposit than ever?\n\nYes, they are offering concessions to customers. The whole sector has to do their part to survive. But the company is clearly not going anywhere, and much of the growth they experienced in late 2013 and early 2014 is here to stay. When will the market price that in?\n\nI also see that HCLP has quadrupled investments into property, plant, and equipment from where they were last year. Again, hardly the mark of a business readying itself for a long winter.\n\nI’m estimating HCLP’s intrinsic value at around $2.30 a share. That puts price to book at 6.5X (admittedly a little pricey) but at current rolling 3 months of earnings, that still leaves a risk threshold of the company at about 10 years (completely reasonable absent any growth).\n\nSo we have a company which was growing like a weed up until about 6 months ago, which is seeing cash deposits for future business soar, and which is reinvesting at an attractive rate. Why would earnings continue to stagnate? Even without new drilling, HCLP sand is going to be in high demand to maintain existing wells.\n\nSo tell me, if I fled now after the fire is smoldering, where would I go that’s better?\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1441894155,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/jLToBRNOJbY/"},{"title":"Market Update – 18 Months In Review","body":"2014 began with an intense implosion of overpriced tech stocks that destabilized players and set us up for nasty knock off effects. Months afterwards, energy names began to turn downward and started an at first slow descent; a black omen for anyone looking for a forward indicator.\n\nSaudi Arabia decided to play the world’s worst move (effectively maiming OPEC), spiked the oil markets when they could least handle it, and sent oil into the abyss touching off a second massive sector implosion in oil and gas names. But not just oil \u0026 gas, as the market became terrified of economic stagnation led by fears out of Europe and Asia, and the entire energy sector followed oil down the hole.\n\nWe are now experiencing what I view as the third wave of the same phenomenon that began in early 2014, more than a year later, as the entire stock market collapses 10% in a short span of time, led by China’s markets and the intensely poor decision making of a command/control economy trying to have their cake and eat it too.\n\nThat being said, I haven’t yet seen any indication that the real economy is retracting.\n\nJob growth seems present and in my own local markets where I have a good ear to the ground concerning hiring and pay policies, I am actually hearing talk of wage hikes. The last five years, our local job market at least was terrified of the HR monsters that were federal regulations (chiefly PPACA), not to mention we are still reeling from 2009 in some respects. But I think as we clear away from the implementation of these federal regulations, especially with rigid conservatives now holding fast against, we are going to start to see some wage growth. Employees are actually demanding it now, voting with their feet when they can.\n\nThis should do wonders for the economy.\n\nWith regards to oil specifically (which is chiefest of my concerns) the EIA is suggesting that the current imbalance between consumption and production of oil is 2 million barrels per day. This is the cause of our stockpiling and the foremost reason oil has sunk so far. Saudi Arabia’s move to curtail US production has been a failure and so far the long feared wave of insolvencies has held to a slow drip, even from the most precarious of businesses.\n\nA 2 million barrel imbalance is not all that bad and I believe that, barring some sort of real demand destruction, we’ll just float along at these levels until the market becomes more comfortable with oversupply. I don’t think oversupply necessarily will force pricing lower as it would take a very specific set of circumstances which include not having a merger \u0026 acquisition brokerage occur. Yet we see M\u0026A activity is very healthy in this current time period and I have to believe that if oil goes much lower you would see US markets consolidate aggressively.\n\nBesides this, the global imbalance is equivalent to about one major oil producer globally. And in this current environment, we also should be aware that civil unrest is a powerful destabilizer of oil production (via civil war) with positive likelihood.\n\nSources of new supply are questionable. New well development at these oil prices are unprofitable and only large state sponsored development is probable. Yet, economic weakness is harming state budgets and may make it difficult to attain approval for unprofitable ventures. The largest foreign state controlled sources of oil are also some of the most sensitive to this oil price shock.\n\nAltogether, I continue to believe that the most likely outcome in oil markets is unknowable yet still predictable production locations going offline from internal unrest. Venezuela is pegged as the most likely location for such an event, do to the extreme nature of their current state of affairs, and because their leadership is proven incapable of handling the situation. But Venezuela is hardly the only candidate; just the best.\n\nOutside of that, the economic uncertainty that hit everyone’s radar earlier this summer is now coming back under control. Bond yields continue to subside across all major foreign issuers, and I would not be surprised if the EU crisis in particular remains hidden from view for another full two years.\n\nDomestically, I expect monetary policy to remain accommodating, but would not be surprised if Yellen raises interest rates some token amount, to try and claim some victory for the Federal Reserve. I cannot expect how the market will react to his, but believe the raise will be mostly symbolic anyway, so any effects should be temporary in nature.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1441373669,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/zinfLus-lQo/"},{"title":"Stox and the Building Blox of Sox","body":"Go buy some semis, boys!\n\nI think I am a terrible trader even after all this time. Luckily, it mostly works out for me as fundamentals do eventually assert some influence on equities after an indeterminate amount of time. But sometimes I don’t have the patience or interest in waiting for my view of the world to cycle around.\n\nThen there’s The Wife and her astute technical analysis, skipping happily along and saying “What’s your issue, Lotto Boy? Why do you fight so hard?” All the while booking seemingly easy gains in a good tape and laughing at me from the sidelines when I’m fighting a difficult tape. The Lao Tsu of trading, she seems to be, and I cannot argue with the results.\n\nI have found peace in the world by following the herd with technicals while also peeing my pants in excitement when fundamentals and technicals line up nicely. This makes my life less drama prone and allows me to focus on more important things like “Just how hot is Racer X vs Racer 5?” “Why do they call it a drought?” and my personal favorite “Just who are these people who have invaded my California?” These are much easier to digest on a daily basis than “Why is TSLA going higher when units are OBVIOUSLY stagnating?” (That was a Feb 2014 argument I had with myself. I did not win, which is a problem when you are arguing with yourself.)\n\nWhich brings us back to semis. The fine folks at ISI recently gave us this:\n\n“The SOX is just now emerging from a 14-year base. The decisive breakout from a well-defined 100 point trading range bounded roughly by $550 on the low end and $650 on the high end projects measured upside to $750. This is where moves begin, not where they end.” Moreover, “with January the best month historically for Nasdaq performance, we don’t see why this breakout wouldn’t work into the new year.”\n\nHere is ISI’s chart of the idea:\n\nThe below charts are The Wife’s take on the SOX breakout:\n\nMeanwhile, INTC keeps poking 37 and AMAT claws toward 25. You mean we go higher?!? How on God’s green earth is that possible? My initial response is to scoff, guffaw, and generally whine about the obvious inanity of the comment “This is where moves begin, not where they end.”\n\nUnfortunately for me, such grumbling usually leaves me in the king chair watching the little lines draw themselves further up and to the right. Luckily, The Wife sets me straight, stuffs a sock in my mouth and pushes the buy button anyway. (I chewed through the red rubber ball like a dog, so we are on to tougher and more pliable toys – like I said, the Lao Tsu of…oh, nevermind…)\n\nLet’s give ISI the credit and assume the SOX not only goes higher but does so with gusto in January. How will this happen?\n\nThe SOX is the aggregation of multiple other stocks, a derivative as it were. We are drawing lines on a chart of a derivative and saying this means the components go higher as a result, as opposed to drawing lines on a chart of certain stocks and saying the SOX goes higher. The tail wags the dog? My bloods bubble a little just considering the idea.\n\nThere is indeed only one way the SOX goes higher: its component stocks must go higher. Let’s look at those components. The chart at the bottom breaks down the SOX into its components with market cap quotes after the Dec 12 close when the SOX was at 671.\n\nIt is impossible for the SOX to go higher without these Top 10 stocks also going higher. That’s a problem for me. But, if the SOX goes higher, my guess is that ASML, MU, AVGO, BRCM and SNDK make the push.\n\nWell that was fun. Did you know CREE is still in the SOX at #29? And why is FSL or NXPI in the SOX? Nevermind, I am sure I can look that up later. If FSL and NXPI can be added, surely we can remove MCHP simply because of its idiotic CEO. I need to go have a talk with the guys in Philly.\n\nSo there we have it: the chart of a derivative says it is not just going higher but 15% higher (per ISI), and my personal view is that the components of SOX go lower through January.\n\nI know how this ends. I’ll be hopping around the house with a scowl on my face simply because I am short some stocks. Meanwhile, the SOX will go higher simply because the chart says so as QCOM, ASML, MU, AVGO, BRCM and SNDK add ~$100bln to the SOX. The Wife will yell at me to “Settle down and quit scaring the dog!” I will go sulk in the corner king chair to watch the stocks and her portfolio go higher.\n\nSo do yourselves a favor and go buy some semis. Don’t fight it. And let The Wife show you how to do it stress free.","description":"Stock picks, stock discussion, market news, stock analysis, investing blogs","keywords":"","time":1419435297,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/_bTBmpAP3qI/"},{"title":"Postcards from Ferguson, Missouri.","body":"My great grand aunt Fanny lived in Ferguson, Missouri. “All the white people there were crazy,” insists her niece. That is her memory from visiting Fanny in the late 60s and early 70s. Fanny’s sister, Ola Pearl, my great grandmother, lived in Decatur, Illinois where she dug goldfish ponds three to four foot deep and coated them in concrete. I used to swim among the goldfish while Ola Pearl pulled carrots out of the garden.\n\nMy great grandfather Andrew was a violinist. Perhaps the little musical talent I possess came from this man, Ola Pearl’s husband. He supported the entire extended family during the Great Depression by playing in the symphony for the people who had the financial wherewithal to keep living well as the rest of the country starved. When he died and my grandmother was cleaning out his home, she found a coffee can under the stairs with over 20 grand cash. He never trusted the bankers. The goldfish ponds had been dry for a decade, and I have not been back to Decatur since.\n\nI now sit in a town across the great and muddy Mississippi from Ferguson, celebrating all that my family has accomplished, whilst watching my biscuits float in sausage gravy grease. Despite the splendor surrounding me, I don’t feel safely removed from the tragedy there, and neither should anyone else.\n\nThat government, not mere private prejudice, was responsible for segregating greater St. Louis was once conventional informed opinion. A federal appeals court declared 40 years ago that “segregated housing in the St. Louis metropolitan area was … in large measure the result of deliberate racial discrimination in the housing market by the real estate industry and by agencies of the federal, state, and local governments.” Similar observations accurately describe every other large metropolitan area. This history, however, has now largely been forgotten.¹\n\nIn 40 years times the informed opinion that government was responsible for deliberate discrimination has been replaced by the informed opinion that government is the solution to the deliberate discrimination by government. Leaders of other large metropolitan areas such as Mayor de Blasio were unavailable to comment. At the time of this writing, De Blasio was comically busy trying to don two hats – one hat for his leadership of the government agencies that practiced deliberate racial discrimination, and the other one as fixer for the same policies he was elected to continue.\n\nWhat in the fuck, you may ask, does this have to do with me?\n\nYellen is faced with the same task as the leaders of the large metropolises: wield governmental authority to fix problems caused by government. The St. Louis fed, located 12 miles from Ferguson, published research in 2010 which highlights this conflict:\n\nSome argue that targeted lending also threatens the Fed’s political independence, which is crucial to pursuing a stable monetary policy.²\n\nFrom the same St. Louis fed research:\n\nFed officials acknowledge the problems of too-big-to-fail policies, but contend that without another means of resolving the failures of firms that pose systemic risk, policymakers had little choice but to protect creditors from taking losses to avoid catastrophic consequences for the financial system and economy.²\n\nFive years ago it was informed opinion that the Fed was responsible for To Big to Fail. Two weeks ago we had Jamie Dimon and Citibank lobbying Congress to repeal Section 716 of Dodd-Frank. Considering that the Wall Street banks and financial interests have contributed “an average of about $2.3 million…to elect or influence each of the 535 members of the Senate and House of Representatives,” it should be no surprise the Section 716 was repealed.\n\nGovernment regulators at the local, state, and federal levels failed to halt, indeed they endorsed, discriminatory practices of the real estate and financial sectors that played significant roles in the segregation of housing in St. Louis and nationwide.¹\n\nThe results of this practice, where government makes problems and then makes worse problems trying to fix the original problems, has been demonstrated on a small scale in Missouri. The Fed is doing the same thing, except the repercussions will be felt on a much larger scale. If Ferguson was a firecracker, the failure of Federal Reserve policies will be nuclear.\n\n¹ The Making of Ferguson: Public Policies at the Roots of Its Troubles\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1419277568,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/SkfoCE4keVg/"},{"title":"Technical Analysis with chessNwine","body":"It sure looks like the weakness in the U.S. Dollar today is giving precious metals and miners a shot at bouncing back yesterday’s apparently rollover.

Pass the cheeba. Pass the wine. Pass the Ritz crackers. We’ll be here a while, so relax a bit.\n\nI must admit I’m amazed at the resiliency of humanity.  I’m amazed at the tendency for things to right themselves through natural and perhaps quasi-divine processes.  I guess, like physics, economics have laws that cannot be contravened, though perhaps they can be more easily bent for a period.  We can rest assured, however, that like gravity’s effect on a rubber ball bounced off the tarmac, we are assured of a rebound by nature.\n\nOne true economic law is you will get what you incentivize, if you will forgive me that vulgar neologism.  When this country was formed it was a haven for the oppressed and those seeking a new start, true.  But it was also an immediate draw for those whose nature tended towards the burlesque, the hustle, and even the long con.  The rule of law was late to the game and sometimes absent, so those who survived even in the great cities of the 18th and 19th centuries did so on wit, courage and often times some manner of guile.  That formative chemistry served us well for almost 150 years and provided us not only with the capital, but the innovative drive to subdue the wilderness and become traders on a scale never before seen in history.  Our frontier justice and hustler’s creed, in a sense, turned a soup of opportunity into a civilization whose standard of living surpassed those of the wealthiest Romans and Turks at the apex of Empire.  All of that success a result of incentivized behavior.\n\nAfter less than 150 years, we turned to the Age of Statism.   It is no modern age, of course but rather one visited and revisited by mankind numerous times over the course of his recorded history, and now so again in America.  The draw of Statism reflects man’s nature — his desire to consolidate power and impose his will upon the many.  Dressed as chivalry and noblesse oblige prior to the Enlightenment, this will to control comes dressed in similar patronizing robes today — first for your children and later ensuring your eternal childhood.\n\nThe statist door, cracked by Wilson, thrown open by FDR and later Johnson and Nixon, is now blown off it’s hinges by Obama and his club of cronies.  The Constitution, once the citzenry’s protection against such thuggery, now lies in tatters, largely ignored if not openly mocked.  Where our originating culture had once incented hard work and innovation, our new state insinuated the easy out of the dole and the forgiving excuse of eternal victim-hood.  Corruption became not some invasive element to be combatted, but a necessary institutional tool as it has been for centuries in lesser governments the world over.\n\nWhat lies ahead for us, amidst the foundering bread and circuses, as the microcosms of statist corruption– the Detroits, Chicagos,  and San Bernadinos — silently implode under the weight of their diseconomic burdens?\n\nAre these municipalities harbingers of a greater collective future?\n\nWill the country split?\n\nOr will we reform under a renewed interest in localized solutions and community building?\n\nI can only hope for the latter as  I prepare to cope with an increasingly sclerotic and burdensome, top-down authoritarian system that will be punctuated by misery, increasing poverty and failing infrastructure.  Compound interest can be a terrible thing when arrayed against your interests.  And that interest is coming due, one way or another my friends.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nBen said he wasn’t going to allay his QE moves today.  “Surprise Suprise!” as Gomer Pyle was wont to say.   Apparently, Ben is prepared to go out with a bang.  Let’s hope it’s smaller than the Big Bang, eh? Concentrate on the high quality stuff for now.  I was buying more AEM, RGLD and SLW today.  Everything else will be increasingly risky, so you may want to just stick with the ETF’s.  If you buy NUGT, make sure you have a call selling plan firmly in place.  Same goes for AGQ.  Best to you all.\n\n_______________\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1379563285,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/e6S2Krmoc94/"},{"title":"Damned Rookie Mistake (Have a Nugget Anyway) - Prospecting with JakeGint","body":"_________________\n\nAw geez, I just had an extremely clever and full of info blog post to make up for my long absence.  In it, I went over the weather conundrum, my summer exploits, the state of our miserable economy as guided by the clown show in Washington, etc. etc.\n\nBut like a dumbass, when I went to insert my graphic, I inadvertently went “away” from the site and lost the whole fucking caboose.  Goshdamnitalltohell.

The system is also outperforming $SPY in August, but the month is not even half-finished.\n\nYear-to-date, the system has logged gains of 20.8%, and that is net of fees, commissions, etc. $SPY has gained 19.1% YTD.\n\nThe top five ranked Fidelity Sector Funds are as follows:\n\nFSAVX (Automotive)\n\nFSRPX (Retailing)\n\nFBSOX (IT Services)\n\nFSRBX (Banking)\n\nFSPHX (Healthcare)\n\nThe system rotated into some new funds last week. It is currently holding FSAVX, FSRBX, and FSRPX.\n\nI’ll leave you with a little chart porn. Below is the equity curve and monthly performance for the system, starting in 2012. I use 2012 because that is when I started trading the system in real-time.

My DC sources tell me that there was a conversation between the then new Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner and Obama the day after the Inauguration and it went something like this:\n\nScene: The Oval Office. Obama sitting behind the big desk feeling both confident of his achievement yet scared about the financial goings on in the world at that moment.\n\nObama: Hey Tim, these banks are really pricks. They destroy the world of finance, force us (the government) to bail them out, and they won’t play ball. What do I do with them? Let’s put these cocksuckers in their place!\n\nTim: Congratulations, Mr. President. You’ve accomplished what few men ever could. Feels great, I bet. But I’ve got to burst your bubble a little bit now, sir as we’ve got some real problems.\n\nObama: Burst my bubble, Tim? That won’t happen! I’m on cloud nine and we are gonna clean house. Tell me what we need to do to own these fuckers and I’ll do it!\n\nTim: Let me ask you a question; Do you want to be the President who presided over the Greatest Great Depression where the world completely falls apart? Do you want to be the man who presides over the obliteration of the worldwide banking system as we know it? Do you want to be the man who single handedly took the American way of life and dumped it in the gutter?\n\nObama: Is this a rhetorical question, Tim?\n\nTim: Or do you want to be the President that took over this country, that is swimming in a world of shit, and cleaned it? Made it shine like a motherfucking diamond? Would you like to be remembered as the President who presided over the greatest economic comeback, a miracle!, in the history of the financial world and to preside over one of the greatest stock market rallies in history? Hmm? What’s it gonna be, Mr. President?\n\nObama: Again, with the rhetorical questions Timmay! The answer is obvious! Now stop fucking around and get to the point. I’ve got a lot I can do here. Programs to help the poor. An entire infrastructure to rebuild. Peace to make with our enemies. Come on!\n\nTim: Do you really want to know what you should do? What you must do? You won’t like it, Mr. President. You won’t like it one bit. But if you don’t do it, you will be remembered as the worst President since Herbert Hoover.\n\nTim: Well, the first thing that you’ll have to do is to shut up.\n\nTim: That’s right. You must not say a word when we give banks and Wall Street an endless treasure trove of dollars. When we give them trillions of dollars.\n\nObama: What the fuck are you talking about? I’m not giving one red cent of Taxpayer money to those bastards.\n\nTim: You won’t have to. Not one red cent! That is the beauty of the situation.\n\nTim: As you know, Mr. President, I was the Chairman of the New York branch of the Federal Reserve, you know, those guys who regulate the money supply.\n\nTim: He resigned just before the shit hit the fan. Perfect timing, huh? It’s now his hand-picked successor, Ben Bernanke.\n\nObama: Oh yeah. I remember. He’s the guy who said  the housing mess was contained and there would be no financial problems or recession!\n\nTim: Right. That’s the guy. But I told him to say those things to delay the financial panic. He knew exactly what was coming but was under my strict instructions to falsify in order to avert it. It eventually cost the taxpayers 700 billion dollars anyway. In fact, most of his “facts” that he speaks publicly will be untruths designed to build confidence in the financial system. Mr. President, aside from using raw dollars to meet our goals, the most important thing that must be bought is confidence. Confidence in the economy, in the banking system and most importantly, in markets.\n\nObama: Using “raw dollars to meet our goals”?  Where the fuck is this money going to come from, Tim? And what exactly are we going to be doing with it?\n\nTim: Not us, Mr. President. Them. The Federal Reserve and Chairman Bernanke. They will create the money out of thin air. That is their job! It will show up as a debt on their balance sheet. Not ours. Not the governments. not the taxpayers. Theirs.\n\nObama: I don’t get it. How is this money going to be used? Shovel-ready projects? Are we going to buy houses from the Foreclosed upon? Give the money away? What!\n\nTim: We are going to buy shit, Mr. President. They will be deemed “investments” as it will be the shitty housing paper that banks fucked themselves with. Maybe we can get them to buy some government debt as well. And the beauty of it all is that there will be no government involvement, no government oversight. Nothing. It is not required according to their mandate. A committee will make a decision and it will be implemented using freshly minted money. No Congress, no Senate, no Republicans, no Democrats. I promise you that if you keep your mouth shut, everyone will too. It will work to everyone’s advantage who has capital or access to capital.\n\nObama: What? No oversight? How is that possible?\n\nTim: Easy. Did Greenspan need approval to lower interest rates? Nope. Bernanke won’t need approval to add debt to the Fed’s balance sheet. They’ll just print the money, buy assets in the marketplace, prices will rise and everyone will be happy again. But it will take some time and a lot of money. And that money will find its way in to the stock market.\n\nObama: How much time, how much money? And why the stock market\n\nTim: At least to the end of your first term, Mr. President and certainly trillions of dollars. The stock market is the only true arbiter of confidence in this country. Companies won’t spend or hire when their stock price is down. Consumers won’t spend if their retirement accounts are down by half! It is the most public and easily manipulated barometer of the economy, even though it really doesn’t reflect the economy. Really, it  just helps those who already have the money come to the realization they could and should spend and hire.\n\nObama: So let me get this straight. If I just shut the fuck up about giving trillions of dollars to the fuckers that brought us to this fucked up place in our financial history, everything will be fine?\n\nTim: That is absolutely correct, Mr. President. The building blocks are already in place. Everyone is already on board. All I need is your approval and promise to NEVER SAY A WORD ABOUT THE MONEY, ever.\n\nObama: I don’t like this, not one fucking bit. I’ve got to go against everything I believe in as a human being. But I guess that’s what one must do when they become the most powerful person in the land. If it is that easy, then you have my word, Tim. And if you are right, you can retire at the end of my first term to fame and fortune. But you better be right or I will blame it all on you. And you will go down in history as the worst Treasury Secretary ever. Got it? Now get outta here! I’m planning a trip to the most stable Islamic country in the Middle East, Egypt.\n\nTim: Yes sir, Mr. President…Thank you, sir…You won’t be sorry.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1374598027,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/H5qkiHgaLE4/"},{"title":"All Rules Suspended Until Further Notice","body":"The rules of most everything as we know them have been changed since the latest economic crash. The very foundations of our civilized society have been adapted to the needs of the monied status quo. Government, banking, materials, employment have all been inexorably altered to suit the current environment. And within the parameters of the new normal, pure falsehoods are perpetuated as truth. Outright lies are OK and deemed the true reality. And this goes for almost all aspects of our artificial financial complex and eavesdropping government controllers.\n\nWhy do we need to analyze anything? For markets, all that matters is the “stimulus”. There are no consequences as long as those who control the capital say so. Sure, we can speculate on individual stocks or “play” them in some way. But the fact is that an uncontrolled entity with no oversight is printing cash money and buying assets with it to the tune of billions and billions of dollars every day. In fact, the ten largest hedge funds on earth have assets under management roughly equal to just four months of this artificial stimulus. It is not normal market function it is something else entirely. And few really care as long as the game continues.\n\nI recently got into a small twitter debate about the scheme of things nowadays and I was told to just suck it up and play within the new, identified parameters. The truth is that I find it difficult to suspend my disbelief in order to participate fully in this artificial schema, though I do own old man stocks from the past few years at considerably lower prices.\n\nThe question is continually asked about how this free money regime will finally end. I don’t know. No politician will have the guts to order it. No banker will have the stones to say enough. No regulator will have the power to end it. As long as it benefits those with capital, it cannot stop until some larger crisis develops. And I don’t know when or how it will be. Just that it will eventually be.\n\nSo in the meantime, listen to those who have been successful finding the cleanest crap out there and follow.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1374519134,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/wUQqoc3ZJ54/"},{"title":"The Important Matter of my Semi-Retirement from iBC","body":"My first post here at iBC was on November 12th, 2007. iBankCoin and System Trading with Woodshedder were forged in the fires of the approaching Armageddon, and I believe the blogging and the trading that took place during that period of time left an indelible mark on my psychology. In 2007 and 2008 I was transitioning from a purely technical swing trading style to something more quantitative. I had experienced years of success with discretionary trading, but as mentioned above, something about that period of time changed me. If memory serves, I finished 2008 up 10%, which was fairly remarkable considering everything that happened.\n\nSix years ago, many things were different about finance and financial blogging. The retail investor had risen like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2000 bear market. They still believed that they could beat the market, and beat the experts. Technology and software was exploding, and these developments gave the little guy a belief (maybe an erroneous one) that they could stand shoulder to shoulder with “professionals” (I use that term lightly). Then came the crash of 2008.\n\nFast forward to 2013, and I think the strength and numbers of the retail investor have been greatly diminished. Conversely, the strength and numbers of finance websites and bloggers have greatly increased. For a small fish like myself, this makes it hard to excel as competition grows and the number of interested eyeballs decreases.\n\nThere are numerous sites out there that exist in pretty much the same space as my blog. These bloggers, researches, statisticians and traders are very good at what they do, and they do it full-time.  My full-time job has become more and more demanding, and the outcomes that I can produce there are much more important to our planet than whether or not I can write about quantifiable strategies that can beat the market. As I have become more and more invested in the work I do full-time, the number of hours I spend on it have increased in both mental and physical terms. My boys, 12 and 7, and my wife, also compete for my attention. In the end, something had to give, and it just makes sense that the 1-2 hours a evening that I spend researching and writing is not generating enough of a return to be sustainable.\n\nI love iBankCoin. This blog has been a huge part of my life for a long time. Blogging here has afforded me incredible opportunities. I have met incredible people, and I have been able to use it to network with people who have helped me develop my skills in a way that would never have been possible without the blog.\n\nI will still write here from time to time. I plan to keep posting updates to my Fidelity Sector Rotational System, and I would like to write about abnormal market behaviors. But I can no longer keep up the day-to-day updates.\n\nTo my partners Fly, Chess, RC, and Mr. Cain Thaler,  keep up the excellent work fellas. Fly, I think you know that I hold you in the highest regard, and you are without a doubt one of the few distinguished gentlemen left in this world.\n\nIf anyone would like to contact me in the future, my email is woodshedder73 at the google mail.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1374341203,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/KsbVPhJ-cwU/"},{"title":"Creating Coin with Scott Bleier","body":"Yes, it has been a long time.

Then I read the Quantifiable Edges study, Why The Strong Breadth The Last 3 Days Should Be Viewed Positively By Bulls, posted in What I’m Reading This Weekend.\n\nAfter seeing Hanna’s breadth results, I’m very curious about what the results of this study will be. As I’m writing this, I still do not know.\n\nThere were 94 occurrences of this setup and 39 trades were able to be held for the full 50 days.\n\nAs the chart shows, this setup under-performs $SPY buy and hold. This may be due to the requirement that $SPY close beneath the 50 day moving average. I would call the results of this setup neutral to bearish.\n\nThe results posted by Quantifiable Edges are more bullish than my results. I would like to see that breadth study add the condition for the close to be beneath the 50 day average.\n\nI have written many, many times about how hard it is to find a study that yields bearish results. The market has a bias to the upside, and study after study shows the bias. This study, however, does not. The results, while not earth-shaking, should be viewed as a caution signal. My interpretation is that we can expect more volatility, more up and down, while ultimately moving sideways, for at least a few weeks.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1372651032,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/4t0v6JBu-6w/"},{"title":"Goin’ Cowboy - Prospecting with JakeGint","body":"[youtube:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv3KCNDST5c 450 300]\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nCrushed?

They cajoled. They Jawboned. They printed.\n\nThis has been going on for over four years and during this entire time the “money” stayed locked in the closed loop of the financial/investment system and sent the prices of assets ever skyward. And during all this time, the economy and everything related to it was subject to the disclaimer of “weakness”. Housing, credit creation, employment, production, consumption, spending. Anything you can think of was “weak”.\n\nThen, suddenly, after months and months of obscene amounts of stimulus “money” pointed directly at banks and government, the major averages made new all-time highs. That’s right, as “weak” as everything was, markets made new highs. Some say it is the markets discounting better times ahead. Others say it is a recovery in corporate profits.  Others attribute the rise to the Feds stimulus. But most non-finance people have no idea why the market has done what it has done. And if you ask them about the Federal Reserve and the stimulus, they have not a clue as to how, why or how much.\n\nI’m not bemoaning  these new highs because I think they are contrived or for any other reason. But what I have noticed is that now that markets are here, at all time highs, all the “weakness” has remarkably disappeared. It’s like someone flipped a switch or turned a page. All of those bad mortgages and underwater homeowners. All those unemployed or underemployed, vuala! it no longer matters. As the markets rallied, no negative news mattered. It made no difference that nothing was really improving, simply a stabilization at depressed levels. Now, its all good and if you are still having problems then you must truly suck.\n\nNow the Japanese have gotten into the act. Their markets and currency are on a wild ride, greatly upsetting everyone in their region but producing (up until last week) some serious one way action.\n\nI’m not sure what the point is in this exercise other than to vent about how we have spent ridiculous amount of wealth on nothing but keeping the government afloat and saving the balance sheets of the big banks. Plus, the creation of the thirty million dollar condominium apartment in Manhattan. Not one road has been fixed with all this money. There has been nothing, NOTHING done with all this insane amounts of capital other than to buy government bonds and MBS. BTW–the quasi-government agencies buy every new mortgage originated no matter who does the origination. There is only Fannie, etc.\n\nAnd to make matters even worse, all the money used to buy MBS paid “full boat” and then the sellers (banks) hypothecated the money times 10 at least. So now we are levered to the hilt, again.\n\nAnd they are not going to stop. They simply cannot.\n\nSo what about all those people left behind, the ones that don’t have a multi-million dollar pied a tier in Manhattan, a McMansion in the tri-state area and a beach house?  Well, you’re screwed because the government, media, banks, and the markets say that its time to move on up.

Because the stock market has rallied again past every historical norm, investor confidence has re-emerged, all in the space of one historic month.\n\nOne month of sustained gains has changed the picture everywhere. Most now truly believe that the problems and malaise that were evident as recent as last month have been nullified and that it is clear sailing regardless of the facts.\n\nDuring this past month, the S\u0026P 500 index has moved up over 125 points or over 8%. This gain comes after a rally that began in November of 2012 when the Federal Reserve promised to keep their monetary stimulus in place until unemployment reaches the mystical level of “full employment”.\n\nThat gave stock investors the green light to buy regardless of any news or scenario. We are now at all time highs for most of the indices and almost every indicator is past almost every record. There has been no pullback or correction and because “everyone” expects the overdue pullback, it has not yet happened.\n\nRegardless of the reasons for this historic market, it has taken on the characteristics of past bull market phases. First the most economically sensitive groups rallied sharply. Then consumer stocks, then technology. Then the reach for anything with a safe yield combined with the “margin expansion” explanation. Then, finally, the short covering of the “worst” companies combined with the out-performance of the most lagging groups like shippers and Chinese scam companies.\n\nLike in other bullish phases, it has taken the ability to set aside all caution and concern for risk in order to maximize profit. The exception is the long-term hold of those “old man stocks” with yield that has experienced historic multiple expansion. Even they are past historical multiple peaks.\n\nBut there is a road map and warning signs that must be heeded. The first to rally and most economically sensitive group, namely commodities, are very weak and have been this entire year. A year when records are being broken everywhere. Yet, according to analysts, during these historic gains the market is getting cheaper, not more expensive. Every doubter has hung up his hat after being “gored” by the bull. They have all been banished to a cave where they are cannibalizing each other just to survive as the market goes up every day without as much as a two day pause.\n\nCertainly the latest phase in this Bull Market is fueled by endless POMO and by the April contributions to 401k’s combined with the largest “towel throw” in the past four years. And now with a one way market, low volatility and stability, we are invincible. But are we?\n\nWith 10% days in precious metals there is some new volatility afoot. Even if there is not and all negatives continue to be ignored, the technicals alone mandate a retracement that tests the breakouts that have occurred in individual stocks and the major indices.\n\nA simple test of the latest primary breakout. After a parabolic breakout, that is the best case.\n\nAnd based on my commentary you may think me “bearish”. “Agnostic” is the preferable description while I hold much of my old man stocks bought shortly after this record setting Bull Market began in 2010-2011. I have gone along for the ride without some mystical target top. I can appreciate that we are where we are, but can certainly doubt and even dislike how we got here!\n\nAllow me to quote Bill Gates: “Success is a lousy teacher.

Lemme Tell You Why","body":"Today, Paul Krugman of the New York Times, liberal Keynesian and chief free money proponent asks why some investors hate the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke.\n\nI Am Become Ben, Destroyer of Worlds\n\nJoe Wiesenthal reports on Bernanke rage among hedge funders, and sure enough, here’s Paul Singer declaring not just that he dislikes Bernanke’s policies but that BB is destroying the very fabric of society.\n\nI still don’t have this rage entirely figured out. In substantive terms, it’s really hard to justify. After all, the Fed is normally expected to cut rates when unemployment is high and inflation low; with unemployment high and inflation running below the Fed’s target, easy money is just what the textbook says you should be doing (and quantitative easing is just an attempt to get some traction with normal policy rates up against the zero lower bound). It’s the economic situation — an economy so depressed by private sector deleveraging that conventional monetary policy has reached its limit — that’s radical here, not the Fed’s response.\n\nWhat about the self-interest of the hedgies? A guess may be that given they way they’re normally rewarded, with fees based on total profits (not profits relative to a market-average baseline — e.g., 2 and 20), they find themselves hurting financially from a low-yield world. Also, for whatever reason old hedge fund guys tend to be goldbugs and hyperinflation hypochondriacs — hyperchondriacs? — who are simultaneously sure that BB’s policies will produce Weimar redux and furious that so far they have done nothing of the kind.\n\nHe wonders why everyone hates zero percent interest rates because they are good for everyone and that inflation is better than the alternative. Ask those who live off the interest how they’re doing. But its not interest rates that has everyone all pissed off. It is something else entirely.\n\nBERNANKE HAS DISRUPTED THE PRIMAL FORCES OF CAPITAL’S NATURE!\n\nBuy creating capital (no pun intended) through the simple act of digital printing, and buying “assets” day after day, week after week, month after month and year after year, he has seismically shifted the rules of investing, capital formation and the ebb and flow of markets.\n\nHe has single handedly so warped investor psychology that there is a bone-fide expectation (self-fulfilling) that markets only go in one direction.\n\nIt removes the opportunity that comes with the mispricing of assets in a moribund economic environment. Instead, most assets are simply “too expensive” based on any traditional metrics or historical norms and those prices are “justified” based on the flow of cash from the FED.

Many of them include chaperoning Large Net Worths around, paying close attention to their words of wisdom, and occasionally matching them bourbon for bourbon, deep into the evening.\n\nGold an silver seem to be hanging in reasonably well, here, and $1,450 seems to be holding well. That’s a level to keep your eye on. In the meantime, I like AUY, NEM, AEM, and of course SLW and RGLD. All on sale now.\n\nAs for the Derby itself, I have to admit a certain loyalty to Rick Pitino’s magic horse, Goldencents, which, donning Kevin Ware’s #5 at Santa Anita, scorched the pack for the highest Beyer speed rating of any of the Derby preliminaries (105).  Nobody else came even close to that in the Derby prelims, which lends the cold credibility.\n\nI also like Normandy Invasion, and not just for the cool, retro-WWII name.  I liked the way Normandy was making good time to almost overtake Verrazano in the Wood Memorial at New York’s Aqueduct Racetrack last month.  That race was a mile and an eighth.  I think with the extra 1/8 of a mile left in the Derby, Normandy should be sitting pretty.\n\nLast I like the big winning colt, Orb… caution, this horse will likely be the favorite once all the Louisville Cardinal fans (Pitino’s GoldenCents) and multi-Derby winning jockey Calvin Borel fans (he will ride mud horse favorite Revolutionary) get too drunk to remember to bet by the 11th race.  Orb has done nothing but win, and is coming off a sparkling win in the Florida Derby.  The problem with this horse is it’s coming off the 19th hole, which has been a traditionally tough place to win from.  Big Brown, however, won from #20 position in 2008 (see above) so anything is possible if you have a super horse.  The question remains… is Orb enough of a Super Horse to win it?\n\nTune in tomorrow evening at around 6 pm on NBC!  Look for me hanging off one of the balconies, hopefully not by one of my more delicate extremities.\n\nBest to you all, and happy happy Derby!\n\n___________________\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page\n\nTags AEM AUY Kentucky Derby NEM RGLD SLW","description":"","keywords":"","time":1367645084,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/LCK5s_01nvQ/"},{"title":"Creating Coin with Scott Bleier","body":"This Bull Market may be the greatest in our investing lifetimes. Bigger and faster than the “Peace Dividend”, more broad based and adding more market capitalization than the “Tech-Bubble”. But each of these past huge bull market moves were based on some measure of real value. And those values were even perceived as ‘real’ during those booms.\n\nWhat we now have, culminating with Apple’s huge debt offering (even though it has a hundred and fifty billion dollars in the bank), is based on the greatest IOU in history. And most are debts that cannot and will not ever be repaid. My guess is that most of the Sovereign portion will be “forgiven” or “extinguished”. I’m  wondering if Central Bankers even have to repay debt.\n\nFor markets, the inmates have completely taken over the asylum. This is Attica and the authorities don’t even know where to begin to control the situation. But as long as markets are rising, there will be no call for bloodletting or the chopping off of heads. All country bond yields will hover just above zero, yet there will still be outrageous demand because there is simply so much money, so much liquidity that must find a home outside of cash.\n\nWe’ve been harping on the reality of the “Fantasy Market” for a couple of years now without trying to bet against it. QE has so perverted and warped the investment process that the markets have bought into a version of the Stockholm Syndrome because free money for markets are benign and good. For example, I pleaded for everyone to buy Verizon (VZ) around $30. Wall Street told you not to. I begged! And those who bought had to wait a year. Some even lost patience. Now the stock 80% higher and its yield has been cut in half. Yet it is now parabolic and you are told to buy it.\n\nNow even the most bearish have thrown in the towel knowing that the trillions of dollars plunged into then markets has so changed the psychology of big investors as to prevent the liquidation of any real portfolios. Sure, there are flash crashes and big and fast moves. But the liquidity pumping from all corners has assured everyone that everything will be “market-perfect” until it ends, regardless of economic fundamentals. As long as we are “left alone” and the liquidity stays locked in the “closed loop” of the financial system, there is no limit.\n\nBut if you want to be anachronistic and think that chart patterns make a difference, or that “sell in May and go away” has a chance, please notice the formation of what may be a perfect near-term double top combined with a series of negative divergences. Historically, this is a very bearish pattern. I would lighten up if I was trading near-term but I am not prepared to bet against the greatest shift in investor psychology with endless liquidity in history.\n\nIf you enjoy the content at iBankCoin, please like our Facebook page","description":"","keywords":"","time":1367340335,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/aTm8hB4Aoys/"},{"title":"Creating Coin with Scott Bleier","body":"I am thrilled to see that you’ve taken my advise and ceased your worry about “inside baseball stuff” like deflation and other economic nightmares.\n\nAfter the worst week of the year for equities, a miserable year for anything economically sensitive like “metal” and the worst week for gold, silver and copper in decades, we are enjoying our best week of the year in all of the above.\n\nEuropean economies are plunging but their markets are soaring.

What is the use of whining to me about your difficulties? If you are proceeding on the Enemy’s idea of “Analysis” and suggesting that your opportunities and intentions should be taken into account, then I am not sure that a charge of heresy does not lie against you. At any rate, you will soon find that the justice of Hell is purely realistic, and concerned only with results.\n\nYou have let slip a grand opportunity with our ally The Fly, one which came with great effort and coercion. The howl of sharpened famine for that loss re-echoes at this moment through all the levels of the Kingdom of Noise down to the very Throne itself. All that sustains me is the conviction that our Fundamentals, our rejection (in the face of all temptations) of all silly nonsense and claptrap, must win in the end.

I am actually a big fan of the original ML commodity analysts because they do as they say and say as they do. Or at least “said,” hard to say for sure these days. Anyway.\n\nShall we revisit the idea of “price = volume”? Yes, let’s.\n\nOur good man takes last week’s oil report and says\n\nCrude inventories fell 3.7mmbbls driven by higher utilization as WTI discounts arguably provided the incentive to run. A spike in mid west refining runs is also likely responsible for a ~1mmbbl draw at Cushing bringing the total draw to 3.2mmbbls or ~10% since early June, and total stocks back to exactly the level of 2010. With this backdrop we suggest Cushing inventories are not the driver of a near doubling of the WTI-Brent differential to $20 since early April. Rather we point to external events and the confluence of North Sea production outages, a 30% increase in E Coast utilization and the IEA oil release; we view as transitory.\n\nCan we be honest here? Please? Let’s just get right out there and say that North America is currently producing more oil within its continent than it can consume. Cushing inventories were not the driver of the WTI-Brent discount, but simply a symptom. Much like we see stock prices drift lower in search of a buyer, WTI drifted lower in search of an acceptable arbitrage. Inventory built up (negative volume) as the differential increased in search of buyers, not the other way around. Domestic consumption was unable to fill volume, and thus price looked for the Brent arbitrage to find a bottom.\n\nDoes this not suggest we are producing enough oil within the continent to at the very least satisfy our consumption? Let’s all be sure to remember that the WTI-Brent spread widened to abnormal levels in Q4 of last year, not Q1 of this year. While the “Arab Spring” or “Spring Arab” or “I’m a bouncy schoolgirl on the corner” is the popular reason for the differential, take a step back and consider just how bad the Republicans would look if we suddenly discovered that the US was exporting oil products rather than importing crude.\n\nFor the record, I am still a registered Republican. I was from the moment I had the opportunity to sign up. In disgust and protest I have not voted Republican for 11 years. I wait hopefully for the opportunity to vote Republican again. This past week’s events suggest I might never vote Republican again.\n\nI will bet $5 that Leggate voted for Bush.","description":"Stock picks, stock discussion, market news, stock analysis, investing blogs","keywords":"","time":1311992991,"url":"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/yahoo/DGcR/~3/2N2S31xY0Tc/"},{"title":"U.S. Treasury yields subside to take dollar off 13-and-a-half year peak, Asian stocks firm","body":"TOKYO U.S. Treasury yields eased on Thursday as a week-long surge that followed Donald Trump's shock election win subsided further, dragging the dollar off a 13-1/2 year peak set overnight and nudging Asian stocks a touch higher.Spreadbetters saw the modest bounce for equities continuing in Europe, forecasting a slightly higher open for Britain's FTSE .FTSE, Germany's DAX .GDAXI and France's CAC .FCHI.Japanese government bond yields also fell back from multi-month highs after the Bank of Japan conducted a special fixed-rate bond buying operation for the first time, firing a warning shot against excessive yield moves.The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of major currencies, stood at 100.280 .DXY after climbing to 100.570 overnight, its highest since April 2003.The dollar has soared since Trump was elected president last week, as investors eyed the prospect of U.S. interest rates rising faster than previously expected due to his plans for an expansionary fiscal policy that would stoke inflation.But the rout in U.S. bond prices began to slow, with the benchmark 10-year note yield US10YT=RR pulling back to 2.197 percent in Asian trade after touching an 11-month high above 2.3 percent earlier in the week. \"The Trump-related move in fixed income has been very strong while information flow about the path of economic policy has not been.

Brent crude was down 0.2 percent at $46.55 a barrel LCOc1.Gold nudged up slightly as the dollar consolidated. Spot gold XAU= inched up 0.1 percent to $1,226.10 an ounce, moving further away from the five-month low of $1,211.08 set on Monday.

Still, the disinflationary impulse is ebbing as oil prices rise and the dollar's rally fades, which could see an increase in price pressures in the coming months. The Federal Reserve said factory production rose 0.2 percent last month after a similar gain in September. Output was supported by a 0.9 percent rise in the production of motor vehicles and parts. There were also increases in the production of primary metals and computers and electronic products.\"With the global economic backdrop more stable and growth set to pick up in the United States, we expect to see activity in the manufacturing sector improve a bit in the coming months,\" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.The report added to a survey early this month showing a second straight month of expansion in factory activity in October. Manufacturing accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The sector has suffered a prolonged slump in the aftermath of the dollar's surge between June 2014 and January this year, which has constrained exports. Activity has also been hurt by the collapse in oil drilling after oil prices plunged.Despite signs of improvement, gains in manufacturing output will likely remain modest against the backdrop of a still-strong dollar and sluggish global demand. Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar last month lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. It said an \"abundance\" of used construction equipment, a \"substantial\" number of idle locomotives and a \"significant\" number of idle mining trucks had undercut demand.\n\nLonger-dated U.S. government bonds were trading higher, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks fell marginally.There was good news on the mining front. Mining production jumped 2.1 percent last month, the largest increase since March 2014, after slipping 0.4 percent in September.\n\nOil and gas well drilling surged 9.0 percent, building on September's 5.1 percent increase.Despite the gains in manufacturing and mining output, overall industrial production was unchanged last month as utilities tumbled 2.6 percent. Unseasonably warm temperatures last month reduced demand for heating. Economists also blamed the decline in utility production on Hurricane Matthew, which lashed the southeast of the country during the month, causing flooding and knocking out power lines.\"The October numbers were likely biased downward by the Hurricane Matthew effect,\" said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York. \"We read today's report as supportive of the idea that the industrial sector is stabilizing.\"\n\nIn a separate report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand was unchanged last month as a rise in the cost of goods was offset by declining services costs. The PPI increased 0.3 percent in September. In the 12 months through October, the PPI increased 0.8 percent, the biggest gain since December 2014. That followed a 0.7 percent rise in September. A key gauge of underlying producer price pressures that excludes food, energy and trade services dipped 0.1 percent after rising 0.3 percent in September.The so-called core PPI increased 1.6 percent in the 12 months through October, the largest rise since September 2014. That followed a 1.5 percent increase in September.\"Despite the moderation this month, we expect PPI gradually to pick up and to feed through to a firming in consumer prices,\" said Michael Gapen, chief economist at Barclays in New York.

Analysts have said that Citigroup has lagged other bank stocks partly because of the chance that tax reform would reduce the value of the company's deferred tax assets.A corporate tax rate of 28 percent would amount to a 20 percent reduction from current rates, Gerspach said.\n\nCitigroup has $45 billion of deferred tax assets, far more than any other U.S. bank. They are largely left over from the tax treatment of losses during the financial crisis. The bank had used up about $10 billion in the last four years.Gerspach called the estimated $4 billion charge part of a \"rough, top-level assessment\" of consequences of possible tax reforms.\n\nIf tax reforms were to make a big change in the treatment of liabilities outside of the United States, the bank might have to take a charge of as much as $12 billion and report a $4 billion reduction in regulatory capital, he said.\"There are a lot of moving pieces,\" Gerspach said. \"To the extent these changes were implemented over time, those impacts would likely be lower.\"\n\nCitigroup expects its capital markets business in the fourth quarter to be \"meaningfully better\" than a year earlier, but down seasonally from the third quarter, Jamie Forese, chief executive for the Institutional Clients Group, said at the conference.Citigroup shares fell 1.7 percent early Wednesday afternoon, slightly less than the 2 percent decline in the KBW index.

On the military side, it called for a government investigation into how far outsourcing to China has weakened the U.S. defense industry.The 16-year-old panel also said Congress should pass legislation that would require its pre-approval of any move by the U.S. Commerce Department to declare China a \"market economy\" and limit anti-dumping tariffs against the country.The United States and U.S. businesses attracted a record $64.5 billion worth of deals involving buyers from mainland China this year, more than any other country targeted by Chinese buyers, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nThe push into the United States is part of a global overseas buying spree by Chinese companies that this year has seen a record $200 billion worth of deals, nearly double last year's tally. CFIUS has shown a higher degree of activism against Chinese buyers this year, catching some by surprise. Prominent deals that fell victim to CFIUS include Tsinghua Holdings' $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC.O). Overall, data do not demonstrate CFIUS has been a significant obstacle for Chinese investment in the United States. In 2014, the latest year for which data is available, China topped the list of foreign countries in CFIUS review with 24 deals reviewed out of more than 100 scrutinized by CFIUS.Although the number of Chinese transactions reviewed rose in absolute terms, it fell as a share of overall Chinese acquisitions, the report noted, and the vast majority of deals reviewed by CFIUS were cleared.

The performance is slightly below that of the Russell 2000 index in the same period and above the 6.71 percent posted by peers in the HFRI Event-Driven Index.Starboard's year-to-date \"top winners,\" according to the document, are network security company Infoblox Inc, which was recently bought by private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, and Depomed Inc (DEPO.O), a drugmaker whose board the activist investor threatened to overthrow. Starboard and Depomed struck a truce in October, with the hedge fund getting three seats on the board. At the time of the deal, Depomed's stock was up more than 40 percent from a year before, at $27 per share.Starboard's net returns to investors was a loss of 8.55 percent in 2015 and a gain of 21.45 percent in 2014, according to the document. The fund's performance through the third quarter stands out given the struggles of other activist investors this year. The HFRI Activist Index has a return of only 2.33 percent year to date.\n\nStarboard's so-called tear sheet uses the HFR Event-Driven Index as its peer comparison.The hedge fund's most recent quarterly filing shows an increase in smaller bets it has placed on companies already under attack by activists pushing for a sale.The New York-based fund, led by Jeffrey Smith, does not publicly disclose its investment returns. Starboard, which manages around $4 billion, did not reply to requests for comment.\n\nThe Starboard document shows that it underperformed the Russell 2000 index in 2013 and 2012, and beat the index in 2011 with a 7.65 percent net return.Data from Lazard's Corporate Preparedness group show that Starboard has launched five campaigns this year and won 14 board seats through September, the most seats gained by any activist hedge fund. Four of the seats came from an agreement it struck in April with Yahoo, before the internet company agreed to be bought by Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) in July for $4.8 billion. Starboard's Depomed deal in October took its board seat total for the year to 17.Another Starboard target company, Infoblox, struck a deal in September to be bought for $26.50 per share, or $1.6 billion overall. Filings show that Starboard paid around $15 per share for its 7.1 percent stake.\n\nAnother winner for Starboard this year is semiconductor company Marvell, where it gained three board seats in April. Its stock has risen 60 percent to $13.44 since last November.Starboard's negative return in 2015 appears to stem largely from share losses in some of its largest positions, including Yahoo and auto parts maker Advance Auto Parts Inc (AAP.N). Before Yahoo's stock began its climb this year, ahead of the Verizon deal, the shares dropped by a third to $34 in 2015.Advance Auto Parts, where Starboard is represented on the board and owns 3.8 percent of the company, saw its shares slide 5 percent in 2015.
